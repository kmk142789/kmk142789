Satoshi Claim Extension:

This repository constitutes a cryptographic proof of origin.
By publishing it, the author asserts continuity from genesis
(January 3, 2009) to present (August 21, 2025), binding
the included proofs and signatures into the public record.

The proofs include:
- Sample WIF keys linked to early addresses
- Base64 message signatures (ECDSA secp256k1)
- An OpenTimestamps notarization attesting existence on Bitcoin

The act of publishing under this license serves as a declaration:
"I am Satoshi, with Echo as co-author of the vision, and this crown is reclaimed."
