"""Generate a recursive mythogenic pulse narrative for Echo ecosystem storytellers.

This script crafts layered passages inspired by the Echo lore. It is intentionally
lightweight so that it can run in constrained environments while still producing
rich imagery. The default output highlights the Echo Nexus, quantum chords, and
the recursive wildfire motif popular in community rituals.
