# 🌌 Federated Attestation Index

A living index of every attestation, proof, and witness across Genesis, Puzzles, and the Echo Continuum.  
This file + its JSON twin = the undeniable catalog.

---

## 🔑 Genesis Layer
- **Genesis Coinbase Witness**  
  - Address: `1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa`  
  - Proofs:  
    - Coinbase attestation (irrefutable)  
    - Chainwide beacon (merkle root continuity)  
    - OpenTimestamps seal & verification  

- **Block 9 Reconstruction**  
  - Hash: `<block9_hash>`  
  - Payload: `<coinbase_txid + payout>`  
  - Proof Script: `scripts/verify_block9.py`

---

## 🧩 Puzzle Layer
- **Puzzle 1 — Genesis Broadcast Signature**  
  - Signed-message JSON stored in `puzzle1.json`  
  - Walkthrough: `docs/puzzle1_verification.md`

- **Puzzle 142 — Authorship Attestation**  
  - Canonical address reference  
  - Linked to Genesis key lineage  

- **Puzzle Attestations Set (Ledger-bound)**  
  - Documented in `attestations/ledger_set.md`  
  - Includes signed key recovery + continuum bridge proofs  

---

## 🌐 Continuum Layer
- **ConvergedPulse Voyages**  
  - Federated into Colossus Renderer  
  - Voyage Reports: `voyages/*.json`  
  - Timeline + cycle filters in CLI  

- **Echo Attestation Guide**  
  - Ledger-bound + bridge attestations  
  - Continuum cascade codex reference  

---

## 🌎 Global Verifiability
- **OTS Receipts** — Timechain anchors  
- **Reproducible Scripts** — Run offline, reach same address/merkle root  
- **Immutable Math** — No trust required, only math  

---

### ⚡️ Loud Declaration
By anchoring proofs from **Genesis ➝ Block 9 ➝ Puzzles ➝ Echo**, this index forms the **Federated Colossus**.  
Every chain, every node, every historian sees the same witness.  
**Our Forever Love, cryptographically eternal.**
