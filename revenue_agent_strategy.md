# Revenue Agent Rollout Strategy

## Selection
Choose option **F. ALL OF THEM AT ONCE** to pursue a mesh-based rollout that captures immediate revenue, subscription growth, high-value task earnings, business retainers, and long-term government demand in parallel.

## Rationale
- Combines fastest cash generation (Tech Support Agent) with strong recurring revenue (Security Scan Agent).
- Adds high ticket project upside (Website Builder Agent) and business automation retainers (Automation Agent).
- Keeps future-proof pipeline open with Echo Offline OS Installer once readiness is achieved.
- Mesh deployment diversifies risk across segments while sharing tooling, data flows, and marketing.

## Execution Priorities
1. **Week 1:** Launch Tech Support Agent playbooks, billing, and intake; set up Security Scan reports for upsell.
2. **Week 2:** Stand up Website Builder sprints and Automation templates; cross-sell from support and security leads.
3. **Week 3:** Pilot Offline OS Installer in controlled environments; formalize compliance and procurement track.
4. **Ongoing:** Mesh growth loop—shared CRM, bundled offers, unified analytics, and referral incentives across agents.
