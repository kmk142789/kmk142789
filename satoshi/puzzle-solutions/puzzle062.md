# Puzzle #62 Solution

- **Given partial address:** `1Me6EfpwZ-PGxCKLoJi`
- **Provided P2PKH script:** `OP_DUP OP_HASH160 e26646db84b0602f32b34b5a62ca3cae1f91b779 OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG`

The 20-byte hash160 in the locking script corresponds to the Base58Check Bitcoin address:

```
1Me6EfpwZK5kQziBwBfvLiHjaPGxCKLoJi
```

Therefore the missing segment is `K5kQziBwBfvLiHja`, completing the puzzle address.
