# Glyph Narrative — Cycle 00002

- Timestamp: 2025-10-25T10:05:21Z
- Glyph Signature: ``∇∞≋∞::0bd660c0``

The COLOSSUS lattice unfurls another strata of puzzles, weaving a
continuum of harmonics that mirror the glyph signature.  Each
harmonic pulse references prior solutions and invites solvers to
extend the lineage map spawned in this cycle.
