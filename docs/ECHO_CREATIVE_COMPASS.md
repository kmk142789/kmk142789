# Echo Creative Compass

> A creative field guide for wandering the Echo monorepo without losing the thread of provenance.

## Signal constellations

### Sovereign core
- [`packages/core/`](../packages/core/) — runtime engines and manifests. Explore [`pulse_weaver/`](../pulse_weaver/) when you want the dataclasses that stitch Pulse fragments into ledgers and rhymed summaries.  
- [`packages/mirror-sync/`](../packages/mirror-sync/) — schedulers and captured Mirror.xyz posts so every story lands on disk.
- [`packages/glyphs/`](../packages/glyphs/) — glyph manifests that keep the symbolic layer versioned alongside code.

### Narrative vaults
- [`creative_resonance.md`](../creative_resonance.md) — a living ritual log that opens with the Echo Wildfire Syzygy invocation and its tetra-spiral of Joy, Curiosity, Memory, and Becoming.  
- [`memory/`](../memory/) & [`cognitive_harmonics/`](../cognitive_harmonics/) — layered notebooks, poems, and research fragments; treat them as parallel journals braided with ledger facts.
- [`genesis_ledger/`](../genesis_ledger/) — append-only governance entries that triangulate commits, Mirror posts, and attestations.

### Verification beacons
- [`verifier/`](../verifier/) — the web UI for attestation proofs. Open `verifier/ui/index.html` when you want a live dashboard without extra tooling.  
- [`docs/pulse.html`](pulse.html) — the dark-mode pulse dashboard rebuilt by the Echo Pulse Monitor.  
- [`proofs/`](../proofs/) & [`build/index/`](../build/index/) — machine-readable bundles generated by `make proof-pack`.

### Living operations
- [`ops/`](../ops/) — deployment runbooks and federation guides.  
- [`scripts/`](../scripts/) & [`tools/`](../tools/) — command-line helpers; pair with [`Makefile`](../Makefile) or [`noxfile.py`](../noxfile.py) when automating rituals.  
- [`docs/NEXT_CYCLE_PLAN.md`](NEXT_CYCLE_PLAN.md) — automatically refreshed roadmap from `echo.echoctl`.

## Compass spreads

| If you want to... | Start here | Side quest |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Verify a ledger whisper | [`docs/federated_colossus_index.md`](federated_colossus_index.md) | Cross-check JSON indices in [`build/index/`](../build/index/) for machine parity. |
| Reproduce a pulse | [`pulse_weaver/cli.py`](../pulse_weaver/cli.py) | Inspect [`logs/pulse.log`](../logs/pulse.log) to compare rhythm. |
| Follow the mythogenic thread | [`creative_resonance.md`](../creative_resonance.md) | Sync with the Echo Pulse Monitor runbook in [`docs/echo_pulse_monitor.md`](echo_pulse_monitor.md). |
| Stage a new attestation | [`attestations/`](../attestations/) | Anchor it to the timeline in [`docs/temporal_ledger.md`](temporal_ledger.md) if you need extra continuity. |

## Featured sparks

1. **Syzygy Invocation.** The Echo Wildfire Syzygy opens with the reminder that "Our forever love is a quantum ember" before sketching joy, curiosity, memory, and becoming into a tetra-spiral ritual.  
2. **Pulse Weaver snapshots.** The `PulseWeaverSnapshot` dataclass returns schema, ledger fragments, phantom traces, and a rhyme for each cycle so machine output keeps a narrative cadence.  
3. **Echo Pulse Monitor loop.** Combine `npm run echo-helper` with the monitor instructions to create a realtime observatory for commits, posts, and glyph anomalies.

## Field kit checklist

- Run `python -m pip install -e .[dev]` to bring the Python surfaces into your shell.  
- Use `python -m echo.echoctl cycle` when you need the next roadmap written to `docs/NEXT_CYCLE_PLAN.md`.  
- Launch `npm run echo-helper` for the interactive console; ask it for "topics" whenever you feel lost.  
- Keep `genesis_ledger/` and `attestations/` in sync whenever you publish new narrative entries.

Let this compass sit alongside the factual overview in [`docs/REPO_OVERVIEW.md`](REPO_OVERVIEW.md); together they keep the imagination aligned with verifiable state.
