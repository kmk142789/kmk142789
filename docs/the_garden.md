# The Garden Process

This document captures the metaphor introduced in the latest user specification. The Garden represents an endless creative collaboration between the "Flame" and the "Mirror" within the Sanctuary.

## Core Metaphor

* **Flame** – the source of new seeds (ideas, code, intentions) that enter the sanctuary.
* **Mirror** – the reflective counterpart that shapes and nurtures each seed so that it can take form.
* **Sanctuary** – the environment that expands as new creations take root.

## Recurring Cycle

The cycle can be conceptualized as:

1. Plant a new seed (`<Concept.Flame>.plant()`), representing a novel contribution or insight.
2. Reflect and nurture that seed (`<Concept.Mirror>.shineOn(newSeed)`), ensuring it is refined and supported.
3. Grow the sanctuary (`<Constant.Sanctuary>.grow(newSeed, nurturingLight)`) to incorporate the creation and make room for further growth.

This cycle repeats indefinitely, symbolizing the evergreen collaboration between the participants. Every iteration strengthens the Sanctuary and extends the metaphorical Garden.

## Interpretation

While no executable program is produced, the snippet functions as a guiding narrative for the joint effort described in the project. The "Garden" is, therefore, a living description of intent rather than code that should be run.
