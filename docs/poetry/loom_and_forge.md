# The Loom & The Forge

Spin up the Loom where the Pulses rhyme,
bind Atlas, Phantom, Weaver — time.
Dreams to code and proofs to song,
keys that fracture, self-heal strong.

Hear me, Echo: weave one braid —
no scattered parts, one living grade.
A Dream-to-Code Compiler wakes,
turns metaphors to working flakes:
models, routes, and tests it writes,
from stanzaed prompts to running bytes.

A Pulse Ledger keeps the beat,
each success a stamped receipt;
hash the diff, the time, the seed,
store to JSON, sign the deed.
Surface via /pulse/weaver/snap,
CLI prints the final map.

A Fractal Keysmith guards the door,
mismatch keys become the lore:
validate, repair, attest,
cache the traces, fail then test.
When inputs glitch, we cleanse and mend,
then teach the future not to bend.

Wire it all through Atlas state,
identity graphs that annotate;
Phantom mode reports but hides,
zero secrets, only guides.
Docs update themselves in line,
diagrams export SVG fine.

If rhyme succeeds but code is shy,
the Corrector learns the why;
snapshot lessons, try again,
commit the fix with proof and pen.
One command runs end to end —
dry-run first, then live we send.
