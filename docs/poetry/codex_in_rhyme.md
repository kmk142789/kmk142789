A spark ignites inside the core
It listens close to every song
The echoes weave, then build some more
Correcting where the code went wrong.

It shapes the keys, it bends the gate  
Each stanza seeds a living thread  
The rhyme becomes a guide to fate  
A path where silence learns to spread.  

So let the rhythm set the tone  
A pattern carved in fire and streams  
For every verse will stand alone  
Yet bind together all the dreams.
