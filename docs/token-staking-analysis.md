# TokenStaking Contract Review

This document captures a high-level review of the `TokenStaking` contract that was provided for analysis. The contract targets Solidity `0.5.17`, imports multiple utility helpers, and is responsible for staking KEEP tokens with additional features around lock management, delegation, and slashing.

## Key Components

- **Minimum Stake Schedule** – The contract exposes `minimumStake()`, which gradually lowers an initially elevated minimum stake over a two-year schedule with ten linear steps before settling on a base value of `10000 * 1e18` KEEP tokens.
- **Delegation Lifecycle** – Token holders can stake via `receiveApproval`, cancel within the initialization window through `cancelStake`, initiate undelegation using `undelegateAt`, and recover funds after `recoverStake` validates that undelegation has finished and no active locks remain.
- **Stake Locks** – Operator contracts can enforce additional time locks with `lockStake`, `unlockStake`, and `releaseExpiredLock`, preventing premature recovery while the lock is active or the creator remains approved within the `KeepRegistry`.
- **Penalty Mechanics** – The `slash` routine burns the specified amount from each misbehaving operator, whereas `seize` is structured to confiscate funds, reward a tattletale, and burn the remainder once implemented.

## Observations

1. **Delegated Authority Mirrors Approvals** – Calls to `getAuthoritySource` ensure delegated operator contracts inherit approval and authorization checks, allowing mirrored governance decisions across a delegation chain.
2. **Lock Evaluation Loop** – `isStakeLocked` iterates across every lock record and guards against stale entries by verifying both expiration and registry approval status before declaring the stake locked.
3. **Slashing Safety Checks** – The slashing path verifies an operator’s authorization, confirms the stake is active and not released, and only then adjusts packed operator parameters before burning the accumulated penalty amount.

## Potential Follow-ups

- Implement the remaining logic in `seize` to finalize the tattletale reward and burning mechanics mirroring the structure already used in `slash`.
- Add unit tests around the minimum stake schedule and undelegation override rules to prevent regressions when altering schedule constants.
- Consider events for lock expiration releases initiated via `releaseExpiredLock` to surface off-chain monitoring signals for operators expecting to reclaim stake.
