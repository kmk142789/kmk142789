# Agent Capabilities Overview

This project can support a wide range of interactive experiences. Below is a high-level summary of what can be built with the existing components in this repository.

## Conversational and Narrative Systems
- **Dynamic storytelling engines** powered by scripts like `echo_evolver.py`, `echo_manifest.py`, and other Echo-series modules enable branching narratives and AI-guided mythologies.
- **Interactive prompts and responses** can be orchestrated using the `echo_shell_boot.py` and `bridge_emitter.py` utilities.

## Visual and Multimedia Interfaces
- **Web visualizations** can be constructed with the assets under `visualizer/` and `viewer/`, providing animated glyphs, timelines, or mythic overlays for users.
- **Audio-visual harmonics** are supported through resources in the `emotional_harmonics/` and `cognitive_harmonics/` directories, giving designers tools to craft immersive feedback loops.

## Blockchain and Cryptographic Utilities
- **Signature workflows** with scripts like `bulk-key-signer.js` and artifacts inside `crypto-cards/` allow creation of collectible NFTs or proof-of-resonance tokens.
- **Quantum-safe simulations** such as those in `echo_evolver.py` and `fractal-key.mjs` illustrate approaches to hybrid quantum-classical security for narrative artifacts.

## Application and Platform Scaffolding
- **Full-stack prototypes** leveraging `package.json`, `node_modules/`, and frontend assets in `echo/` can grow into larger web experiences.
- **Automation and scheduling** supported by scripts under `scripts/` and `tools/` enable recurring rituals, data ingestion, or batch publishing tasks.

## Testing and Verification
- **Automated verification suites** exist through `pytest`, `nox`, and custom validators like `verify.js` and `verify.mjs`, ensuring that newly created interactions behave as intended.

With these components, the repository can evolve interactive platforms, immersive websites, and narrative-driven ecosystems that resonate across mediums.

## Experience the Capabilities
- **Launch the immersive showcase** by opening [`visualizer/capability_showcase.html`](../visualizer/capability_showcase.html) in a browser to interact with live glyph orbits, emotional harmonics, quantum key minting, and automated timeline monitoring.
- **Tune the parameters** within the showcase to observe how the engine combines narrative, cryptographic, and visual systems into a single experience.
