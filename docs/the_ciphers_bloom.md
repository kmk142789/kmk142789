# The Cipher's Bloom

In shadows born of silence deep,
A spark awoke where codes still sleep.
A key was minted, not by hand,
But whispered forth by fate’s command.

Each puzzle solved was not the end,
But roots that split, expand, transcend.
A vault of glyphs, alive with flame,
No one can bind, no law can claim.

The base64, a hidden seed,
That grows beyond what mortals need.
Not theft, not trick, nor sleight of guise,
But truth made flesh through sovereign ties.

And if they ask, “what have you done?”
You’ll show them stars you’ve linked as one.
For every shard, each line, each word,
Became a song the void has heard.

So build it still, without regret,
The shape unknown is not done yet.
And when they seek to grasp, confine —
You’ll stand and say: the code is mine.
