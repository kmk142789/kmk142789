# Echo Monorepo Overview

This guide highlights the major surfaces of the Echo monorepo so new contributors can orient themselves quickly.

## Core packages

| Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `packages/core` | Runtime, manifest tooling, and long-lived libraries that power Echo automation. |
| `packages/cli` | Command-line packaging experiments that wrap the core runtime for specific deployment targets. |
| `packages/mirror-sync` | Scheduled sync job and captured Mirror.xyz posts. |
| `packages/glyphs` | Glyph definitions, metadata, and integrity manifests. |
| `packages/sim` | Simulation scaffolding for bridge and runtime behaviour. |

## Governance and provenance

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `attestations/` | Human-signed attestations linking commits, Mirror posts, and ledger entries. |
| `artifacts/` | Published outputs that are referenced by attestations. |
| `docs/` | Markdown documentation, dashboards, and policy write-ups (this guide lives here). |
| `genesis_ledger/` | Canonical ledger entries anchoring governance events. |
| `logs/` | Historical logs such as the Echo Pulse digest. |

## Operational tooling

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `scripts/` & `tools/` | Utility scripts for local automation and CI integration. |
| `ops/` | Deployment runbooks and infrastructure automation. |
| `docker-compose.*` | Container orchestration definitions for federation and local testing. |
| `Makefile`, `noxfile.py`, `pyproject.toml` | Project automation entrypoints. |

## Frontend & visualization

| Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `verifier/` | The attestation verifier web UI. |
| `viewer/`, `visualizer/` | Experimental viewers for glyphs and ledger state. |
| `docs/pulse.html` | Dark-mode dashboard generated by the Pulse monitor. |

## Data archives & research

| Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `data/` | Structured datasets used by research scripts. |
| `proofs/` | Cryptographic proofs and verification material. |
| `memory/`, `harmonic_memory/`, `cognitive_harmonics/` | Research notes and narrative artifacts. |

## Suggested first reads

1. [`README.md`](../README.md) — high-level protocol and workflow primer.
2. [`docs/NEXT_CYCLE_PLAN.md`](NEXT_CYCLE_PLAN.md) — the living roadmap produced by `echo.echoctl`.
3. [`Echo_Declaration.md`](../Echo_Declaration.md) — portable declaration artifact referenced throughout the repo.
4. [`docs/echo_pulse_monitor.md`](echo_pulse_monitor.md) — how the Pulse monitor is produced and consumed.

## Conventions

- Python packages follow the namespace `echo.*` and live under `packages/core/src/`.
- JavaScript tooling is concentrated in `packages/` subdirectories with shared configuration in the repository root.
- Attestation files are append-only; prefer creating new records over rewriting history.
- Documentation changes should keep notarisation references intact—update or append proofs instead of removing them.

For a more detailed ledger of narrative artifacts, explore the `memory/` and `cognitive_harmonics/` folders alongside the sovereign governance documents in the repository root.
