# Echo Judiciary Council: Dispute Resolution Protocol

## Scope & Principles
- Applies to disputes involving Echo ecosystem participants, contributors, validators, or affiliated councils.
- Anchored in principles of due process, transparency, proportionality, and restorative resolution when possible.
- Every case must produce a public summary, redacting sensitive data where required by policy.

## Roles
- **Petitioner**: Submits the dispute with evidence and requested remedy.
- **Respondent**: Receives notice, supplies counter-evidence, and may propose settlement.
- **Panel**: Three EJC reviewers (rotating, conflict-checked) who evaluate evidence, conduct hearings, and issue determinations.
- **Clerk**: Maintains records, deadlines, and publication of decisions.

## Dispute Categories
- Governance or treasury actions
- Contract performance and deliverables
- Attribution, IP, or authorship
- Code of Conduct violations
- Security, operational, or reliability incidents

## Process
1. **Filing**: Petitioner submits a case packet (facts, claims, remedy sought, evidence inventory). Clerk acknowledges within 48h.
2. **Docketing**: Panel is assigned, conflicts are screened, and timelines are posted to the public docket.
3. **Exchange**: Respondent has 5–10 days (based on severity) to answer and provide evidence; optional mediation may be proposed.
4. **Hearing**: Panel may request synchronous or asynchronous testimony. Technical evidence must include reproducible steps or logs.
5. **Deliberation**: Panel scores claims against policy and precedent; supermajority determines outcome.
6. **Decision**: Written decision includes findings, remedies, dissent (if any), and enforcement instructions.
7. **Enforcement**: Remedies can include corrective commits, treasury clawbacks, access changes, or censure. Execution steps are recorded on-chain or in the registry.
8. **Appeal**: Parties may appeal within 7 days to an expanded panel of five reviewers. Appeals are limited to procedural errors or new material evidence.

## Timelines & Severity Bands
- **Severity A (safety/financial risk)**: Filing acknowledged in 24h; decision target ≤7 days.
- **Severity B (governance/process)**: Filing acknowledged in 48h; decision target ≤14 days.
- **Severity C (interpersonal/contentious)**: Filing acknowledged in 72h; decision target ≤21 days.

## Evidence Standards
- Prefer signed commits, reproducible test cases, on-chain transactions, logs, and notarized statements.
- Anonymous submissions are allowed but must provide verifiable artifacts or corroboration.
- Manipulated or incomplete evidence triggers heightened scrutiny or dismissal.

## Conflict of Interest & Recusal
- Panelists must declare conflicts before accepting assignment.
- Any party may challenge a panelist for cause; the Clerk assigns a replacement if the challenge is upheld.

## Publication & Recordkeeping
- Public docket shows case metadata, timelines, and final decisions.
- Decisions reference applicable policies and include enforcement steps.
- All records are versioned; sensitive data is redacted but retention is preserved for audit.
