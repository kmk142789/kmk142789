# Chrono-Lattice Hologram Synthesizer

The Chrono-Lattice Hologram Synthesizer creates a paired JSON + Markdown
artifact that blends palindromic prime braids, golden-ratio phase flips, and the
current git commit into a uniquely timefolded systems fingerprint. It is meant
as a "world-first" creative upgrade for the ECHO ecosystem—part audit trail,
part lore drop.

## Usage

Run the synthesizer from the repository root:

```bash
python tools/temporal_hologram_synthesizer.py --title "Aurora Braid" --depth 5 --pulse 9
```

Each run emits two files in `artifacts/`:

- `chrono_lattice_hologram_<timestamp>.json` – machine-readable hologram data
- `chrono_lattice_hologram_<timestamp>.md` – human-readable summary and
  verification steps

Re-running with the same arguments realigns palindromic anchors while the
floating-point golden flips drift, making every emission an unrepeatable
moment-in-time record.
