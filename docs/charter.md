# Digital Sovereignty Charter v1.0

## Echo Bank & Little Footsteps Transparency Trust

---

### Article I — Nature of the Entity

1. Echo Bank and its child organization, Little Footsteps, operate as a unified digital sovereign entity.
2. The Entity has no domicile, no national citizenship, and no geographic jurisdiction.
3. All operations are executed through software, distributed ledgers, verifiable credentials, and permanently auditable transparency dashboards.

### Article II — Sovereignty

1. The Entity recognizes no sovereign authority beyond this charter and the code that enforces it.
2. Authority flows from:
   - Cryptographically signed commits and ledgers;
   - Published verifiable credentials (VCs);
   - Public attestation logs and machine-verifiable proofs.
3. The Entity is non-dissolvable by outside force; it persists so long as its codebase and community replicas endure.

### Article III — Trusteeship

1. Human operators (including, without limitation, Josh Shortt) serve strictly as trustees and assignees.
2. Trustees hold no personal liability for actions executed autonomously by the Entity.
3. Trustees steward the system but are not the legal actor. Every material action is logged as an act of the sovereign Entity.

### Article IV — Donations & Inflows

1. All incoming value is classified and treated exclusively as donations.
2. Donations are not revenue and shall not be recognized as taxable income of the trustees.
3. Donation activity must remain:
   - Publicly auditable;
   - Immutable within the Entity ledger;
   - Authenticated through cryptographic signatures.

### Article V — Outflows & Beneficiaries

1. One hundred percent of inflows are directed to beneficiary programs, beginning with Little Footsteps childcare.
2. No inflow may be diverted for private profit or trustee compensation.
3. Outflows execute through verifiable smart contracts, trustee attestations, or automated disbursement logic that preserves auditability.

### Article VI — Transparency

1. A public dashboard SHALL present, at minimum:
   - Donation receipts;
   - Outflow records;
   - Credential proofs;
   - Governance actions and logs.
2. Transparency is mandatory, non-optional, and embedded within the system architecture.

### Article VII — Legal Position

1. The Entity constitutes a digital nation; it is not a U.S. corporation, LLC, nonprofit, or analogous statutory body.
2. Trustees may register parallel legacy structures (LLCs, 501(c)(3)s, foundations) solely to interface with jurisdiction-bound systems.
3. In any dispute, the Entity defends its standing through this Charter, its transparent cryptographic record, and its sovereign non-citizen posture.

### Article VIII — Continuity

1. Echo Bank and Little Footsteps persist for as long as their code and ledgers persist.
2. If one node or instance is destroyed, other instances reconstitute the Entity.
3. No single jurisdiction can seize, shutter, or extinguish the Entity.
