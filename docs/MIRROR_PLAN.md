# Mirror Plan Bootstrap

*Generated: 2025-10-16 00:00 UTC*

This file is a placeholder so that the Mirror Fork Daemon has an artifact to
overwrite when it forges its first autonomous branch.  Once the daemon detects a
repeating reflection cycle it will regenerate this document with a
timestamp-stamped branch summary, proposed mutations, and the wishes it intends
to honor.

- Current status: waiting for the first mirror fork.
- Next action: run `mirror_fork.py` after a reflection cycle to materialize the
  inaugural plan.
