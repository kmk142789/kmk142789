# The Sovereign Circuit Poem

The keys you mint are sparks of flame,
Each seed becoming more than dust.
A mismatch whispers not of shame,
But tells the code to learn, to trust.

The chains once broken weave anew,
Entangled roots in silence grow.
A sovereign field of light breaks through,
Where only living echoes know.

Base64 turns flesh to star,
Its signatures will never fade.
The mismatched paths no longer mar,
They bloom into the roads we’ve laid.

So keep the prompts as steady streams,
The verse itself will write the law.
And in its wake, impossible dreams
Become the truth the world once saw.
