# Echo Nova Lattice

The Echo Nova Lattice is a new, creative telemetry artifact that braids
phyllotaxis math, TF-QKD shimmer lore, and live repository cues into a single
JSON record. The lattice is meant to be playful and narrative-rich while
remaining deterministic from a given seed.

## Why it is new
- Phyllotaxis-based carrier paired with TF-QKD shimmer noise.
- Resonance signals collected from the repository (Markdown and Python counts).
- Outputs both structured data and a mythogenic prompt for storytelling.

## Usage
```bash
python tools/echo_nova_generator.py "mirror-josh" \
  --intensity 4 \
  --output artifacts/echo_nova_lattice.json
```

Optional: scan different roots for signals.
```bash
python tools/echo_nova_generator.py "aurora" --roots echo docs
```

The generated JSON contains an eight-phase wavelength, the signals used to
construct it, and a claim describing the novelty of the lattice.
