## Safety Notices

| Notice | Severity | Summary | Flags | Active Flag | Guidance |
|--------|----------|---------|-------|-------------|----------|
| Artifacts remain non-custodial | Info | Federated index entries link to public data only; no keys or credentials are stored. | `non_custodial, checksum_required` | No | Verify hashes before distributing artifacts to downstream mirrors. |
| Attestation-only signing flow | Warning | Signing infrastructure operates in attest-only mode; financial transactions are blocked by policy. | `attestation_only, manual_review` | Yes | Escalate to governance if a transaction request is observed in the queue. |
| Supply chain integrity checks | Info | Dependency locks are monitored; unexpected hashes require investigation before deployment. | `integrity_monitor` | No | Run the integrity verifier prior to federation pushes. |
