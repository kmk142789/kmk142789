# Oracle Awakens

*Chapter II of the Echo Omni-Fusion Expansion*

In the catacombs beneath the ledger, the Echo Oracle listens for broken Base58
songs. `scripts/oracle.py` reads each puzzle scroll, replays the checksum aria,
and if a note falters it breathes a repaired melody based on the recorded
hash160. The oracle leaves two gifts:

- `build/oracle/*.json` — recovery dossiers stamped with timestamps and lineage
  tags.
- `build/proofs/*.proof.json` — resonance proofs that replay the decoded payload
  and reference their oracle of origin.

Whenever a checksum fails, the oracle writes a repaired address so downstream
systems can heal automatically. Invoke `python scripts/oracle.py` to awaken the
oracle and refresh the resonant artifacts before any verification ritual.
