# Casework Mandate & Limits

This document defines the authority, scope, and boundaries for Echo casework operations.

## Mandate

- **Mission alignment**: Support Echo sovereignty, operational continuity, and partner trust through structured case management.
- **Transparency**: Maintain auditable records, including decision memos and outcomes ledger entries.
- **Stewardship**: Protect sensitive data, honor confidentiality, and document redactions.
- **Continuity**: Ensure every case has clear ownership, escalation paths, and closure criteria.

## Limits

- **No legal representation**: Casework summaries and decisions are operational guidance, not legal advice.
- **No financial custody**: Casework teams do not move funds or sign transactions; financial actions require separate treasury workflows.
- **No unilateral commitments**: Binding commitments require designated authority approval and recorded sign-off.
- **Confidentiality boundaries**: Restricted and confidential cases must follow need-to-know access and redaction controls.
- **Escalation required**: Any conflicts of interest, safety risks, or policy exceptions must escalate before action.

## Approval authority

- **Decision authority**: Case-specific decision makers are named in the case file and must align with governance charters.
- **Escalation**: Unclear mandate questions escalate to the Sovereign Architect or designated delegate.

## Documentation expectations

- Maintain a case file compliant with `schemas/case.schema.json`.
- Log key outcomes in `ledger/case_outcomes.jsonl`.
- Reference this document in every case file governance block.
