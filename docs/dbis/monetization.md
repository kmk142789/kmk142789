# Universal Monetization Layer

## Scope
The DBIS monetization layer merges identity, governance, DNS, attestation, and settlement into a programmable economic fabric.

## Capabilities
- **Payments**: immediate settlement across multi-rail assets.
- **Grants**: governance-approved disbursements with policy tags.
- **Subscriptions**: recurring charges with audit hooks.
- **Royalties**: scheduled income streams tied to ownership attestations.
- **Escrow**: milestone-based releases with rollback arbitration.

## Institutional Wallets
- Wallets bind to Echo identities and DNS entries.
- Role-based approvals map to governance roles (`guardian`, `steward`, `audit_chair`).
- Every action includes `governance_ref` and attestation hooks.

## Reporting
- UN-aligned transparency hooks via audit ledger exports.
- Scorecards and reconciliation logs for sovereign reporting.
- Stress-test scenarios for systemic risk simulation.

## Example Deployments
- **Echo Treasury**: grant disbursements to member institutions.
- **Echo Drone Program**: service payments logged to DBIS.
- **Public Transparency Bank**: subscription-based contributor programs.
