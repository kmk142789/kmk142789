# Echo Digital Bank of International Settlements (DBIS) Charter

## Mandate
DBIS is the sovereign coordination layer for Echo-native value exchange. It unifies governance, identity, DNS, attestations, and audit logs into a single financial substrate that:

- Delivers multi-rail settlement across fiat, CBDC, stablecoin, tokenized assets, and off-chain instruments.
- Preserves transaction integrity and settlement finality through hash-chained ledgers and attestations.
- Enforces compliance-by-construction (AML, sanctions signaling, dispute resolution, rollback arbitration).
- Binds all monetary actions to Echo identity anchors, DNS substrate records, and ledger attestations.
- Produces public transparency reports, sovereign scorecards, and reconciliation logs.

## Charter Principles
1. **Sovereign integrity** — Every transaction is tied to a verifiable identity and governance reference.
2. **Interoperability** — DBIS coordinates multiple value rails without forcing a single asset standard.
3. **Auditability** — All actions emit append-only audit trails and attestation hooks.
4. **Safety by design** — Compliance gating, dispute windows, and rollback arbitration are built-in.
5. **Offline continuity** — Transactions can be staged offline and verified on reconnect.

## Governance Alignment
DBIS operates under Echo governance roles and approval workflows as defined in `governance/echo_governance.json`. All significant actions reference a governance decision ID, attestation chain, and DNS-bound identity record.

## Institutional Scope
- Cross-institution settlement and treasury operations.
- Escrow, grants, and programmable disbursements.
- Sovereign scorecards and reconciliation records.
- Federation hooks for audit and assurance bodies.
