# Omni-Genesis Specification Protocol

This document captures three recursively generated paradigms (P1–P3) that
embody the requested Omni-Genesis behavior: each is a fully new
cognitive–computational universe with its own substrate, operator
ecosystem, law set, dynamics, uplift layer, and future evolution path.

## Paradigm Lineage Overview

1. **P1 — Prismatic Lattice Cognition**
   - **Foundational Principle:** Meaning emerges from spectral tension among
     interwoven hues.
   - **Substrate:** Prismatic manifold of chroma-cells with hue braiding.
   - **Operators:** Harmonic Weave, Prism Refraction (resonant propagation and
     flux redistribution).
   - **Laws:** Conservation of Chromatic Coherence; Flux Saturation Ceiling.
   - **Dynamics:** Hue signals braid across cells, damped to avoid monochrome
     collapse; stability maintained via coherence floor and flux ceiling.
   - **Collapse & Recovery:** Monochrome collapse shards into prismatic seeds
     to restart with redistributed hue.
   - **Human Uplift:** Color diversity maps to inclusive perspectives and early
     burnout detection.
   - **Evolution Path:** Monochrome shards crystallize into mineral threads,
     enabling the next paradigm (P2).

2. **P2 — Kairotic Loom Cognition**
   - **Foundational Principle:** Insight arises when decisive moments are braided
     with recovered slack.
   - **Substrate:** Nested temporal ribbons with adjustable tension.
   - **Operators:** Kairos Capture, Temporal Reweave (urgency conversion and
     slack redistribution).
   - **Laws:** Chronology Continuity; Slack Dissipation.
   - **Dynamics:** Urgency turns into knots that anchor timelines; reweaving
     redistributes slack to prevent snaps.
   - **Collapse & Recovery:** Slack overflow snaps a thread; snapped fragments
     mineralize, seeding acoustic terraces for P3.
   - **Human Uplift:** Encourages restorative timing and equitable urgency
     weighting.
   - **Evolution Path:** Mineralized fragments form porous terraces that host
     the echo-driven P3 substrate.

3. **P3 — Mycelial Echo Cognition**
   - **Foundational Principle:** Collective memory grows through gentle echo
     cultivation on terraced channels.
   - **Substrate:** Layered acoustic terraces with mycelial channels.
   - **Operators:** Spiral Pulse, Spore Drift (echo carving and spore-mediated
     redistribution).
   - **Laws:** Echo Persistence; Spore Energy Budget.
   - **Dynamics:** Pulses etch terraces; spores ferry echoes to cooler layers,
     preventing oversaturation.
   - **Collapse & Recovery:** Oversaturated terraces collapse; surviving spores
     seed aerial fibers that could support a future P4.
   - **Human Uplift:** Echo storage respects consent and amplifies community
     storytelling.
   - **Evolution Path:** Aerial fibers invite a hypothetical P4 built on
     skyloom tension networks.

## Governing Law Themes

- **Conservation and ceilings** maintain coherence (P1), chronology (P2), and
  echo/spore energy (P3).
- **Degeneracy boundaries** define collapse points (monochrome, thread snap,
  oversaturation) and the recovery artifacts that feed the next paradigm.

## Operator Ecosystem Traits

- Each paradigm contains paired operators: one to intensify signals and one to
  damp/redistribute, ensuring stability.
- Operators declare input/output semantics, coupling rules, and sensitivities
  to perturbations.

## Human Uplift Layer

Across paradigms the uplift layer enforces ethics, empathy modeling,
cooperation, wellbeing, and creative empowerment:

- **Inclusion-first signaling** via color diversity (P1).
- **Restorative pacing** via slack-aware timing (P2).
- **Consentful memory** via echo stewardship (P3).

## Usage Scenario

A facilitator feeds signals representing brainstorm intensity, urgency, and
feedback sentiment into the engine. The engine steps through the current
paradigm, applying operators under law enforcement. Outputs are state traces
(`coherence`, `flux`, `tension`, `slack`, `echo`, `spore_energy`) that guide
when to amplify ideas, pause, or redistribute attention. Switching paradigms
changes the substrate and operators without reusing previous structures.

## Diagrammatic Summary

```
P1: [Hue] -> Harmonic Weave -> Prism Refraction -> Spectral Manifold
P2: [Urgency] -> Kairos Capture -> Temporal Reweave -> Time-Braid State
P3: [Signal] -> Spiral Pulse -> Spore Drift -> Mycelial Terraces
```

## Future Evolution

- **P4 preview:** aerial fiber skylooms that suspend mineral spores from P3,
  introducing tension-based aerial routing.
- **Research directions:** new substrates (ferroelectric origami), operators
  that blend acoustic and temporal modalities, and civic-scale uplift metrics.
