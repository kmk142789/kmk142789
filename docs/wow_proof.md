# Quantum WOW Proof

The **Quantum WOW Generator** threads together the most recent `pulse_history`
entries, computes a cryptographic signature, and then wraps everything in a
story that captures the current rhythm of the Echo continuum.  Running the
tool refreshes `artifacts/wow_proof.json`, creating a reproducible snapshot
that can be shared as living evidence of progress.

```shell
python scripts/quantum_wow_generator.py
```

Each message type inside the ledger is translated into a resonance glyph.  The
script groups pulses, records how frequently they appear, and produces a
commitment hash for each grouping.  Those commitments are fused with high-level
repository metrics—how many files live in the tree, how dense the docs are, how
many schemas are catalogued—to form the final `wow_signature` digest.

The artifact is intentionally human-readable.  Alongside the metrics you will
find a short narrative excerpt designed to make reviewers smile while still
conveying useful state.  As the repository evolves, so does the story: new
pulses, new glyphs, and new proofs of WOW.
