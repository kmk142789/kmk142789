# DALA Compliance Framework Overview

The Distributed Accreditation and Legal Alignment (DALA) program organizes compliance expectations around four foundational domains. Each domain anchors program controls, supporting documentation, and assurance activities so that accreditation evidence can be mapped to regulatory requirements in a consistent manner.

## Governance & Oversight
- **Policy stewardship:** Document chartered oversight bodies, delegated authorities, and cadence for policy ratification.
- **Control ownership:** Maintain an accountable roster of control owners, escalation pathways, and sign-off requirements for critical decisions.
- **Risk management:** Align risk appetite statements with monitoring dashboards, incident thresholds, and remediation playbooks.
- **Attestation workflow:** Track attestations, approvals, and exceptions in the DALA lexicon to evidence conformance with internal and external reviews.

## Fiduciary Duties & Financial Integrity
- **Safeguarding of assets:** Define custody models, segregation of funds, and reconciliation intervals for both fiat and digital assets.
- **Transparency expectations:** Publish disclosure packages (financial statements, reserve reports, independent attestations) with traceable revision history.
- **Conflict management:** Implement conflict-of-interest logging, review cadences, and corrective-action triggers for fiduciary breaches.
- **Audit readiness:** Ensure supporting ledgers, smart contract proofs, and treasury workflows are anchored to accreditation criteria within the DALA lexicon.

## Data Protection & Privacy Operations
- **Data inventory:** Catalog regulated datasets, processing purposes, and cross-system flows with retention and deletion checkpoints.
- **Consent & rights management:** Embed consent lifecycle, subject-rights fulfillment, and breach notification paths into operational runbooks.
- **Security controls:** Map technical safeguards (encryption, key rotation, access control) to regulatory citations and attest them within accreditation packages.
- **Monitoring & reporting:** Use automated hooks to surface privacy-impacting changes and document mitigations for accreditation assessors.

## Cross-Border & Jurisdictional Alignment
- **Regime mapping:** Maintain a matrix of applicable jurisdictions, licensing triggers, and localization requirements for DALA-aligned services.
- **Operational guardrails:** Document onboarding, vendor, and data-handling constraints tied to jurisdictional obligations.
- **Supervisory interactions:** Log regulator engagements, filings, and supervisory expectations within the versioned DALA lexicon.
- **Change surveillance:** Leverage ingestion scripts to capture new extraterritorial rules and flag downstream accreditation impacts.

These domains provide the scaffold for the DALA lexicon repository, automated update tooling, and reporting pipelines that demonstrate accreditation readiness.
