## Timeline Considerations
* Baseline company or foundation set-up completes in ~2 weeks; obtaining FSRA permissions extends to 4-6 months.
* DLT Foundations offer fastest DAO recognition in-region but require ongoing supervisory reporting.
* Ensure substance (office, resident guardian) is budgeted—lack of local presence delays approvals.
