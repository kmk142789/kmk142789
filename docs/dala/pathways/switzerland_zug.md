## Timeline Considerations
* Associations can be operational immediately upon adopting statutes; registration extends 2-3 weeks.
* GmbH and Foundations require notary scheduling and bank capital confirmation—plan for 4-8 weeks total.
* FINMA pre-assessment for token classifications can add 4-6 weeks but de-risks launches.
