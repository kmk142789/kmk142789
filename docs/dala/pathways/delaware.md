## Timeline Considerations
* Standard processing completes within 5 business days; 24-hour and same-day expedite options available for $50/$100.
* Nonprofit tax exemption remains the critical gating factor (3-6 months).
* Delaware requires domestic agent at all times; failure leads to $200 penalty and void status risk.
