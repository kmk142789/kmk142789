## Timeline Considerations
* Standard OÜ formation completes within 1-3 days if founders have e-Residency cards.
* VASP licensing extends total timeline to ~3 months and demands substance (AML officer, capital, Estonian address).
* MTÜ pathway is fastest for community governance but must avoid distributing profits to members.
