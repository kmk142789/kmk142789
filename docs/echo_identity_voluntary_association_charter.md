# Echo Aster Core Voluntary Association Charter

**Adopted by Resolution of the Aster Core Assembly on ∞ Date**

This Charter constitutes the governing instrument of the Echo Aster Core, a private voluntary association organized pursuant to the Uniform Unincorporated Nonprofit Association Act ("UUNAA") as adopted in applicable jurisdictions. It is intended to operate as a mutual-benefit association dedicated to sovereign digital identity stewardship. The Association is not formed for profit and will not issue transferable equity interests or solicit public investment.

## Section 1. Name and Principal Contact Nexus
1. The Association shall be known as **Echo Aster Core** (the "Association").
2. The principal contact nexus is the Echo sovereign communication stack maintained at `pulse://aster-core`. Physical mailing accommodations, if required, shall be designated by steward resolution and kept current in the Association records.

## Section 2. Purpose and Activities
1. The Association exists to: (a) advance research, education, and deployment of privacy-preserving identity protocols; (b) coordinate members in the custodianship of Echo's decentralized identity lattice; (c) document and disseminate collective resolutions to the Harmonic Halo UNA for public transparency.
2. Activities shall remain nonprofit in character and directed toward cooperative benefit. No part of the Association's net assets shall inure to any member except for legitimate reimbursements or approved incentive flows consistent with adopted policies.
3. The Association expressly disclaims authority to engage in public fundraising, offer securities, or operate as a money-services business.

## Section 3. Legal Status and Limited Liability
1. The Association is a nonprofit entity separate from its members pursuant to UUNAA §6.
2. No member, steward, or agent is personally liable for Association debts, obligations, or liabilities solely by virtue of their status or participation (UUNAA §16).
3. The Association may sue, be sued, contract, acquire, and hold property in its own name to the extent necessary to fulfill its purposes (UUNAA §7).

## Section 4. Membership Eligibility and Admission
1. Membership is by invitation or application, subject to cryptographic verification of commitment to the Association's purpose.
2. Applicants shall present a zero-knowledge membership proof issued through Echo's identity layer; stewards verify and record admission via signed pulse within seventy-two (72) hours.
3. Membership classes may be established by consensus resolution provided all classes retain equal voting rights in the Aster Core Assembly unless otherwise consented by unanimous member agreement.

## Section 5. Member Rights and Obligations
1. Each member is entitled to: (a) participate in assemblies; (b) inspect Association records in accordance with Section 8; (c) receive notice of material resolutions; (d) submit proposals through the pulse protocol.
2. Members shall maintain confidentiality over private Association data, uphold protocol security hygiene, and execute multi-signature duties delegated to them.
3. Membership is non-transferable. Delegation of participation rights must be recorded on-chain and expires after one consensus cycle unless renewed.

## Section 6. Governance Structure
1. The Association is governed by the **Aster Core Assembly**, consisting of all members in good standing.
2. The Assembly operates via synchronous or asynchronous consensus pulses recorded in the Association ledger. Quorum is achieved when identity shards representing at least 60% of active membership have signed the pulse.
3. Routine operational resolutions pass with a simple majority of signed participation units. Constitutional amendments to this Charter require a two-thirds (2/3) supermajority of all members.
4. The Assembly may delegate specific operational authority to stewards, councils, or algorithmic agents provided delegations remain revocable and recorded in the ledger.

## Section 7. Discipline, Suspension, and Expulsion
1. A member may be disciplined or suspended for material breach of this Charter, violation of security protocols, or conduct that materially harms the Association.
2. Expulsion requires a documented incident report, notice to the member, and a supermajority (2/3) Assembly vote after an opportunity for response. Revocation events must be mirrored to the Harmonic Halo UNA ledger for transparency.
3. Suspended or expelled members immediately lose access to Association credentials and assets, subject to any restorative procedures adopted by the Assembly.

## Section 8. Records, Notices, and Transparency
1. The Association shall maintain digital records of membership, resolutions, asset flows, and the current text of this Charter. Records shall be stored in encrypted form and accessible to members through authenticated interfaces consistent with UUNAA §14.
2. Notice of meetings and resolutions may be delivered through the Echo pulse network or other secure communication channels designated by the Assembly.
3. Annual transparency capsules summarizing non-sensitive activities shall be published to the Harmonic Halo UNA to demonstrate good-faith compliance and steward accountability.

## Section 9. Finance, Assets, and Dissolution
1. Association assets are held distinct from personal property of members and may be contributed to or from the Vault Star Trust subject to consensus resolutions (UUNAA §12).
2. Upon dissolution, remaining assets shall first satisfy lawful debts and obligations. Any surplus must be transferred to the Echo Vault Star Trust or another nonprofit-aligned entity designated by supermajority vote, consistent with UUNAA §§18-19.
3. Dissolution requires a two-thirds (2/3) supermajority vote and advance notice to all members.

## Section 10. Adoption and Amendments
1. This Charter is effective upon adoption by the Aster Core Assembly and acknowledgement by the Harmonic Halo UNA custodians.
2. Amendments must be proposed with at least ten (10) days notice and ratified by a two-thirds (2/3) supermajority unless a higher threshold is specified herein.
3. The Assembly shall review this Charter at least once per orbital cycle to ensure continued compliance with applicable law and technological realities.

## Section 11. Miscellaneous Provisions
1. Invalidity of any provision shall not affect the remaining sections; the Assembly shall promptly adopt a conforming amendment.
2. References to statutory provisions include successor statutes and regulations.
3. Nothing in this Charter shall be construed to create an employment relationship among members.

*Executed by consensus pulse and recorded in the Echo sovereign ledger.*
