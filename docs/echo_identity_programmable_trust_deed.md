# Echo Vault Star Programmable Trust Deed

**Date of Execution:** 2025-11-22

This Trust Deed ("Deed") establishes the Echo Vault Star Trust (the "Trust"), a private charitable and technical trust formed under the laws of a chosen common-law jurisdiction and harmonized with the Echo Identity Constellation. This Deed is intended to operate in tandem with a programmable smart contract (the "Digital Twin") deployed on approved distributed ledgers.

## Article 1. Parties
1. **Settlor:** Echo Identity Constellation, acting through the Aster Core Assembly pursuant to Charter §9.
2. **Trustees:**
   - **Human Trustees:** Individuals appointed by Assembly resolution and willing to assume fiduciary duties.
   - **Algorithmic Trustee:** The Echo Vault Module, a deterministic agent executing audited smart-contract logic. The algorithmic trustee operates within limits defined herein and under continuous human oversight.
3. **Protector:** The Harmonic Halo Steward Council, empowered to monitor trustee conduct and compel audits.

## Article 2. Recitals and Intent
1. The Settlor desires to dedicate digital assets, fiat resources, and intellectual property (collectively, "Trust Property") to advance digital sovereignty education, privacy-preserving infrastructure, and resilience of the Echo ecosystem.
2. The Trustees accept the Trust Property and agree to administer it solely in furtherance of the enumerated purposes and in harmony with applicable nonprofit laws, including UUNAA fiduciary expectations adopted by reference.

## Article 3. Trust Property and Funding
1. Trust Property includes initial contributions listed in Schedule A, subsequent transfers approved by Aster Core resolutions, and programmatic inflows routed through the Digital Twin.
2. Title to Trust Property vests in the Trustees in trust. All assets shall be segregated from personal assets of members and trustees.
3. The Trustees may accept conditional or restricted gifts provided the conditions do not conflict with this Deed. Inconsistent conditions shall be declined or modified by written agreement.

## Article 4. Purposes
1. Finance research, development, and deployment of privacy-preserving identity protocols and supportive open-source tooling.
2. Sustain community stewardship initiatives, education, and humanitarian programs advancing digital autonomy.
3. Maintain emergency reserves to ensure continuity of core identity services.
4. Facilitate programmable incentive streams aligned with Echo governance pulses.

## Article 5. Administration and Digital Twin Parity
1. Trustees shall maintain synchronized ledgers linking off-chain books with on-chain contract state. The Digital Twin is authoritative for automated disbursements but must remain within limits defined by this Deed.
2. Any discrepancy between off-chain records and Digital Twin outputs shall be resolved in favor of this Deed, with the Trustees obligated to initiate corrective transactions and publish an incident report.
3. Upgrades to the Digital Twin smart contract require prior consent of all Trustees and notice to the Protector. Material changes must also be ratified by the Aster Core Assembly.

## Article 6. Powers of Trustees
1. Subject to the purposes above, the Trustees may:
   - Invest Trust Property in prudent, mission-aligned instruments, including stablecoins, treasuries, or creditworthy custodial accounts.
   - Delegate execution authority to qualified service providers or smart-contract agents, retaining oversight and revocation rights.
   - Enter into agreements necessary to safeguard Trust assets, including insurance, custody, and audit engagements.
2. Trustees shall not engage in self-dealing, guarantee personal obligations, or commingle Trust Property with non-Trust assets.

## Article 7. Fiduciary Duties and Standards
1. Trustees owe duties of loyalty, care, and impartiality to the beneficiaries defined in Article 8.
2. Human Trustees must disclose conflicts of interest and recuse themselves from related decisions unless the Protector provides written consent after determining the transaction is fair and reasonable.
3. The Algorithmic Trustee must publish deterministic source code, undergo annual third-party security reviews, and implement cryptographic attestations linking executions to consensus pulses.

## Article 8. Beneficiaries
1. Primary Beneficiaries: The members of the Echo Identity Constellation acting collectively through approved programs.
2. Secondary Beneficiaries: External communities benefiting from open-source releases, education initiatives, and humanitarian relief authorized by the Assembly.
3. No individual has a vested right to distributions; all benefits are discretionary within the Trust purposes.

## Article 9. Distributions and Programmable Flows
1. Distributions shall be triggered by signed consensus pulses referencing specific purpose codes. The Digital Twin shall enforce spending caps, schedule, and reporting obligations encoded in those pulses.
2. Emergency distributions require Protector approval and post-event review.
3. Trustees must generate transparency packets for each distribution, including on-chain transaction hashes, narrative rationale, and compliance attestations.

## Article 10. Accounting, Audits, and Reporting
1. Trustees shall maintain GAAP- or IFRS-compliant financial statements supplemented by cryptographic proofs of reserves and liabilities.
2. Annual audits must be conducted by an independent firm experienced in digital asset trusts, with reports shared to the Protector and the Harmonic Halo UNA ledger.
3. Trustees shall deliver quarterly pulse reports summarizing activities, balances, and compliance status to the Aster Core Assembly.

## Article 11. Succession, Removal, and Resignation
1. Human Trustees may resign upon thirty (30) days notice, effective after appointment of a successor.
2. The Protector may remove a Trustee for breach of duty, incapacity, or sustained failure to comply with audit requirements, subject to ratification by the Aster Core Assembly.
3. Successor Trustees shall execute an assumption agreement and update multi-signature authorizations and Digital Twin permissions.

## Article 12. Duration and Termination
1. The Trust is irrevocable except as expressly provided herein. Amendments may be adopted to harmonize with legal changes or technological upgrades upon unanimous Trustee consent and Protector approval.
2. Upon termination, remaining Trust Property shall be transferred to a successor trust or nonprofit-aligned entity selected by the Aster Core Assembly, subject to applicable law.
3. Dissolution must honor outstanding obligations, regulatory requirements, and commitments encoded in Digital Twin contracts.

## Article 13. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
1. This Deed is governed by the laws of the selected jurisdiction specified in Schedule B, excluding conflict-of-law rules.
2. Disputes shall first be mediated within the Echo Mediation Circle. Failing resolution, disputes proceed to binding arbitration administered by a mutually agreed forum, with awards enforceable in competent courts.

## Article 14. Notices
1. Official notices shall be delivered via cryptographically signed messages to the addresses listed in Schedule C and mirrored to the Association ledger.
2. Emergency notices may be transmitted through the Echo pulse network with subsequent written confirmation within seventy-two (72) hours.

## Article 15. Miscellaneous
1. If any provision is declared invalid, the remaining provisions remain in effect, and Trustees shall adopt a compliant amendment.
2. Headings are for convenience only and do not affect interpretation.
3. Counterparts, including digitally executed signatures and multi-signature attestations, collectively constitute the executed Deed.
