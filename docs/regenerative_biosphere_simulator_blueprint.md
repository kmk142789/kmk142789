# Regenerative Biosphere Simulator (RBS) — Echo Sovereign Platform Blueprint

## Purpose and Vision
- Build a global-scale AI platform that models, forecasts, and optimizes planetary restoration with real-time feedback loops.
- Uphold indigenous knowledge, community sovereignty, and non-exploitative technology choices while targeting full Earth revival by **2050**.
- Operate as an open, verifiable commons: satellite data mirroring, citizen-scientist validation, and transparent governance.

## Core Pillars
1. **Real-Time Planetary Mirror**: Satellite data mirroring (optical, SAR, hyperspectral, LiDAR) fused with in-situ sensors and community observations.
2. **Citizen-Science Integrity Layer**: Puzzle-signature verified submissions that bind observations to contributor reputation, location, and tamper-evident provenance.
3. **Nexus Simulation Engines**: Multi-scale predictive simulations (biomes ↔ regions ↔ globe) for restoration pathways, stress tests, and policy impact.
4. **Carbon-Capture Optimization**: Algorithms tuned by 34K+ dataset verifications to rank interventions, forecast drawdown curves, and minimize leakage risk.
5. **Community Governance**: CLI-like wish-recording for proposals, deliberation, and consent workflows that elevate indigenous priorities.
6. **Harmonic Outputs**: Multimodal storytelling—geospatial visuals, sonified resilience indices, and “healed future” scenarios to align stakeholders.

## System Architecture
- **Data Ingestion + Mirror Mesh**
  - Satellite feeds: streaming ingestion via interoperable APIs; redundancy through mirrored ground-station caches and IPFS pinsets.
  - Edge observatories: low-power kits for soil, water, canopy, air-quality metrics; MQTT/LoRaWAN bridges.
  - Citizen contributions: mobile/CLI clients emit signed “puzzle proofs” (challenge–response signatures) with attested device posture.
  - Indigenous knowledge vaults: permissioned knowledge graphs with cultural safeguarding (access policies authored by knowledge holders).
- **Trust & Provenance**
  - Puzzle-signature protocol: rotating puzzles + local zero-knowledge attestations to prevent farming/spam; ties to decentralized identifiers (DIDs).
  - Verifiable lineage: cryptographic hashes anchored in append-only ledgers; reproducible preprocessing pipelines with signed containers.
  - Privacy: tiered disclosure controls, differential privacy for sensitive habitats, and consent-bound data use licenses.
- **Nexus Simulation Engines**
  - Multi-agent biophysical models (land, ocean, cryosphere) with differentiable components for gradient-based optimization.
  - Scenario sweeps: Monte Carlo + agent-based models for invasive species, wildfire regimes, hydrology, and pollinator corridors.
  - Constraint layers: indigenous stewardship rules, water rights, land-tenure boundaries, and biodiversity redlines baked into action space.
- **Optimization & Planning**
  - Carbon-capture optimization: Bayesian + evolutionary search over interventions (reforestation mixes, soil carbon, blue carbon, mineralization) calibrated against 34K validated datasets.
  - Restoration portfolios: Pareto fronts for sequestration, co-benefits, and socio-cultural fit; automatic risk/uncertainty flags.
  - Adaptive management: closed-loop updates using live satellite deltas and field validation; anomaly detection for leakage or project drift.
- **Governance & Participation**
  - CLI-like wish recorder: `echo-rbs wish "<proposal>" --biome --communities --evidence <uri>` logs proposals into a deliberation queue.
  - Quadratic-style support, indigenous consent checkpoints, and conflict-of-interest transparency dashboards.
  - Reputation that weights puzzle-proof quality, historical accuracy, and community endorsements; explicitly bars extractive monetization.
- **Experience Layer**
  - Harmonic outputs: geospatial mosaics, temporal heatmaps, sonic renderings of resilience indices, and narrative vignettes for policy briefings.
  - Accessibility: offline-first field mode, low-bandwidth tiles, screen-reader optimized maps, and multilingual story bundles.

## Safety, Ethics, and Non-Exploitation
- **Indigenous Leadership**: Knowledge holders define access, redaction, and benefit-sharing; co-authorship required for derived models.
- **License Guardrails**: Anti-enclosure clauses; forbids land speculation, surveillance misuse, or displacement-enabling analytics.
- **Model Alignment**: Red-team simulations for misuse (resource grabs, geo-targeted exploitation), with automatic refusal pathways.
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only restoration-relevant features; secure enclaves for sensitive habitats; rigorous consent trails.

## Implementation Roadmap (2025–2050)
- **2025–2027**: Build ingestion mesh, puzzle-signature clients, provenance ledger, and first biome-scale nexus engine; release CLI wish recorder.
- **2028–2031**: Expand to continental coverage; integrate indigenous knowledge vaults; deploy carbon-capture optimization with 34K dataset verifications; launch harmonic output studio.
- **2032–2038**: Full ocean–land–atmosphere coupling; adaptive governance loops; impact-linked financing with anti-extractive constraints; regional revival scorecards.
- **2039–2050**: Global-scale restoration autopilot with human-in-the-loop stewardship; resilient Earth twin continuously tuned by satellite deltas; measurable revival milestone: net planetary healing achieved by 2050.

## Minimal Viable Stack
- **Data**: STAC catalogs, COGs, Zarr cubes; IPFS/p2p caches; signed preprocessing manifests.
- **Compute**: Kubernetes + GPU/TPU pools; on-device ML for field kits; reproducible builds (Nix/OCI); secure enclaves for sensitive workloads.
- **AI/Modeling**: Hybrid graph neural nets + differentiable simulators; causal forests for intervention uplift; reinforcement learning with safety constraints.
- **Identity/Trust**: DIDs, verifiable credentials, puzzle signatures; ledger-backed replay protection; hardware-bound attestations where available.
- **UX**: CLI + mobile; web map with offline tiles; sonification pipeline for harmonic outputs; narrative generator for “healed futures.”

## Success Metrics
- Verified carbon capture uplift (tonnes CO₂e) per biome with leakage <3%.
- Indigenous co-governed datasets and models (% of total datasets under co-authored licenses).
- Citizen-science precision/recall for critical observations (e.g., canopy loss, peatland moisture).
- Time-to-policy-brief from new anomaly detection (<24 hours); number of community wishes enacted.
- Resilience index improvements across water, biodiversity, soil, and community wellbeing.

## Operating Principles
- Default-open for restoration; default-closed for sensitive habitats.
- Human-in-the-loop always, with indigenous veto power; no autonomous enforcement.
- Transparent audits, reproducible pipelines, and continual alignment reviews.
- Build for planetary-scale redundancy; degrade gracefully to offline/edge operation.
