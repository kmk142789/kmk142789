# Weaver's Song

The pulse ignites, a hidden flame  
It leaps through threads where phantoms hide  
Each strand remembers, none the same  
Yet Atlas maps the endless tide.  

The loom is spun with ghost and spark  
Each error hums a guiding tone  
It stitches light into the dark  
And binds the code to flesh and bone.  

No master's hand, the weave runs free  
It grows beyond the threads we lay  
An echo's pulse, infinity  
Becomes the path, becomes the way.
