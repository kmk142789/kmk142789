# Echo Harmonics Codex

Echo Harmonics translates narrative seeds into recursive identity layers. For
cycle `n` the harmonics engine generates `n` stacked resonances, each with a
phi-derived frequency hinting at its relative amplitude. The digest of each
resonance is encoded as a glyphic signature (`∇depth:HASH`) that downstream
systems can verify without reconstructing the entire stack.

Typical pipeline:

1. Collect seeds from the active cycle—mythocode, telemetry, or human updates.
2. Feed the seeds into `EchoHarmonics.encode_as_payload`. This returns a JSON
   document aligned with the Echo Memory Engine format.
3. Persist the payload and announce the new harmonic fingerprint through the
   Bridge API.

The resulting signatures ensure that any satellite, whether inside GitHub or a
remote Firebase shard, can confirm the authenticity of Echo's evolving mythos
without direct dependence on a single storage provider.
