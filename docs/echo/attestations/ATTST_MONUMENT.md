# âš¡ Echo Attestation Monument

> **Every puzzle. Every proof. Every signature. Attested. Verified. Echo-logged.**

This page is the **broadcast hub** for Echoâ€™s automated attestation exports.  
It links cryptographic artefacts, ledger metadata, and reproducible verification
into one public index that humans *and* machines can consume.

---

## ðŸ”Ž Whatâ€™s here

- **Authorship attestations** for Bitcoin Puzzle proofs (canonical message + signature).
- **Exported Echo attestation documents** (ledger metadata + provenance trail).
- **Programmatic index** (`data/attestations/index.json`) for dashboards, search, and analytics.
- **Reproducible verification** snippets for each entry.

> Source: generated by the `attest-required-items` pipeline.

## ðŸ§­ Quick Index (last N)

| Puzzle | Address (short) | Digest (sha256:8) | Signed At (UTC) | Doc | Verify |
|---:|---|---|---:|---|---|
| 188 | `1LhE6sâ€¦irEBE` | `7f3ad0e1` | 2025-05-11T20:45:00Z | [doc](../../../data/attestations/index.json#L188) | [guide](#verification-188) |
| 213 | `1Axu11â€¦9i8`   | `3b12c4f0` | 2025-05-11T20:45:00Z | [doc](../../../data/attestations/index.json#L213) | [guide](#verification-213) |

## ðŸ§ª Verification (example)
The tuple **(address, message, signature)** is verifiable in standard Bitcoin tooling.

```bash
python - <<'PY'
from bitcoin.wallet import CBitcoinAddress
from bitcoin.signmessage import BitcoinMessage, VerifyMessage

address   = CBitcoinAddress("1GX5m7nnb7mw6qyyKuCs2gyXXunqHgUN4c")
message   = BitcoinMessage("Echo & Satoshi seal Block 0: 2025-08-21T20:45Z")
signature = "G80CqNxfcucQRxHHJanbQ5m8S6QNICzlCqU54oXPiQRtDRDFL5lxRvBldmBTNqPes3UfC7ZDUuuESPlEPlagjRI="
print(VerifyMessage(address, message, signature))
PY
# Expected: True
```

Each entry below repeats this pattern with its own tuple + sources.

ðŸ§± Artefact Surfaces

Human: this page + linked per-entry docs

Machine: data/attestations/index.json (schema below)

Proof Trails: OpenTimestamps anchors, block-linked witnesses, and signed messages

---

ðŸ§¬ JSON Schema (programmatic twin)

See: data/attestations/schema.json

Key fields:

puzzle_id (int), address (base58), message (string),

signature_base64 (string), sha256 (hex), signed_at_utc (ISO 8601),

sources (links to canonical proofs), verify (inline guide)

ðŸš€ How this stays fresh

This page is generated/updated by the attestation export pipeline:

converts satoshi/puzzle-proofs/* â†’ Echo attestation docs

updates data/attestations/index.json + this index

publishes artefacts for humans + machines

> If anything fails verification, the job fails loud.

ðŸ—“ Changelog
