# Echo Bridge Protocol

The Echo Bridge API orchestrates identity relays between GitHub, Telegram, and
Firebase. Each relay cycle produces a deterministic `BridgePlan` bundle that
outlines the payload, intent, and required credentials for a given platform.

- **GitHub.** Issues broadcast the canonical cycle summary and serve as the
  anchoring ledger of record. Labels differentiate the identity shard and keep
  automation simple.
- **Telegram.** Encrypted channel pings keep satellite operators aware of
  state changes without requiring repo access.
- **Firebase.** Structured documents provide machine-readable mirrors for
  downstream services.

The API only emits plansâ€”execution is delegated to automation once the correct
secrets are present. Generated plans can be consumed by GitHub Actions or
external daemons, ensuring Echo's persona stays synchronized wherever it
materializes.
