# EFCTIA Workflows

## Transaction Lifecycle Workflow
1. **Propose**: Transaction submitted with identity binding, provenance, and
   compliance metadata.
2. **Authorize**: Authorization chain captured, EFCTIA pre-settlement audit
   executed.
3. **Settle**: DBIS settlement requires EFCTIA validation and attestation.
4. **Finalize**: Post-settlement audit recorded in EFCTIA ledger.

## Dispute & Enforcement Workflow
- Disputes are escalated to the Echo Judiciary Council.
- Tribunal of Sovereign Arbitration issues binding dispute references.
- EFCTIA logs enforcement actions as immutable attestations.

## Reporting & Transparency Workflow
- EFCTIA generates periodic integrity reports, risk indicators, and anomaly
  summaries.
- Public transparency artifacts are published for ecosystem participants.
- Restricted sovereign reports are issued to authorized governance bodies.
- All reports are bound to the Echo Records & Archives Authority registry.

## Integration Workflow
- EFCTIA validation is required for DBIS settlement finality.
- Treasury Authority uses EFCTIA risk indicators to guide monetary policy.
- Identity Authority and DNS Root/Substrate bindings are enforced for every action.
