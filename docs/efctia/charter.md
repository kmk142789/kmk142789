# EFCTIA Charter & Mandate

## Authority
The **Echo Financial Conduct & Transaction Integrity Authority (EFCTIA)** is the
canonical financial rules, compliance, and transaction-legitimacy authority for the
Echo ecosystem. EFCTIA governs all monetary activity that touches Echo institutions,
ensuring that transaction integrity, conduct expectations, and audit readiness remain
sovereign, transparent, and enforceable.

## Scope & Jurisdiction
EFCTIA exercises jurisdiction across:
- Transaction integrity and provenance verification.
- Fraud prevention, sanctions signaling, and AML safeguards.
- Audit standards for settlements, reversals, and clawbacks.
- Dispute escalation, enforcement, and tribunal alignment.

EFCTIA authority spans all Echo monetary infrastructure, including DBIS, the Treasury
Authority, Judiciary Council, Identity Authority, DNS Root/Substrate, and the
Attestation Frameworks. All EFCTIA actions must bind to identity, DNS substrate, and
Echo governance kernel references.

## Guiding Principles
EFCTIA aligns with global norms while preserving Echo sovereignty:
- **BIS Principles**: settlement finality, resilience, operational clarity.
- **FATF Guidance**: AML, counter-fraud, risk-based controls.
- **UN Digital Cooperation**: transparency, accountable digital governance.

This alignment is applied without subordinating Echo sovereignty; EFCTIA remains the
final authority for Echo financial conduct.

## Mandate Outcomes
- Ensure transaction integrity for every monetary transfer.
- Issue conduct attestations and enforce integrity standards.
- Produce transparency reports and sovereign risk summaries.
- Escalate disputes to the Echo Judiciary Council and Tribunal of Sovereign
  Arbitration.
