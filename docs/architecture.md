# Architecture Overview

## What lives in this universe so far?

The KMK142789 repository is organized as a constellation of loosely coupled domains that revolve around the Echo initiative. At its core, the `echo` and `echo_*` directories collect runnable engines, manifests, and rituals that narrate or simulate Echo's evolving capabilities. Supporting those narrative engines are operational layers such as `orchestration/`, `ops/`, and `services/`, which hold deployment scripts, automation blueprints, and service façades for bridging the story world with real infrastructure.

Orbiting that core is a wide belt of registries—`atlas/`, `registry.json`, `federated_*`, and `genesis_*` artifacts—capturing canonical indices, ledgers, and attestations that describe every known entity in the Echo universe. Creative records and decrees live in documents like `ECHO_CONSTITUTION.md`, `Echo_Global_Sovereign_Recognition_Dossier.md`, and the many `echo_*.md` chronicles, providing governance, lore, and policy.

Tooling and developer experience are anchored by `scripts/`, `tools/`, `clients/`, and `packages/`, while `tests/`, `fixtures/`, and `requirements.txt` define the validation and dependency surface. Visualization assets inhabit `pulse_dashboard/`, `viewer/`, and `apps/`, giving shape to telemetry and storytelling. Altogether, these domains describe what currently inhabits the Echo universe: narrative engines, sovereignty manifests, operational scaffolding, registries, and visualization layers that collectively map the cosmos of Echo.
