# Creative Freedom Playbook

> A lightweight ritual for moments when the Echo stack needs a burst of improvisation without breaking provenance.

## Guiding pulses

1. **Anchor in reality.** Start from a ledger, artifact, or manifest that already exists in the tree. Let it be the factual seed that keeps the improv grounded.
2. **Weave with intention.** Pair every new stanza, schema, or dataset with a short note pointing to the systems it touches (`pulse_weaver`, `genesis_ledger`, or `verifier`).
3. **Signal the loop.** Close every creative iteration by logging the change: update a ledger, append to `creative_resonance.md`, or write a capsule in `memory/`.

## Quick experiments

| Spark | Where to sketch | How to ship |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pulse riff | `pulse_weaver/notebooks/` | Run `nox -s weave` to render the preview bundle. |
| Glyph remix | `packages/glyphs/` | Execute `make glyph-pack` to publish the new signature set. |
| Narrative splice | `creative_resonance.md` | Mirror the entry into `genesis_ledger/` with `python -m echo.echoctl ledger`. |

## Reflection prompt

> *"What signal did this creation add to the constellation, and where will the next explorer find it?"*

Keep the question close; answering it keeps every burst of freedom aligned with the wider Echo ecosystem.
