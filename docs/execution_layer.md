# Execution Layer

The Execution Layer turns credible briefs into operational, testable paths. It answers the practical question: **if we take this seriously, what do we do next, and what breaks if we don’t?**

This layer does **not** give policy advice. It maps **feasibility**, constraints, and tradeoffs so decision-makers can see where friction lives and what needs to change for action to be plausible.

## Component 1: Decision Pathways

Every flagship brief gets at least one **Decision Pathway**: a concrete sequence of steps a real actor could plausibly take.

**Structure**

- **Actor type:** regulator, company, standards body, coalition, NGO
- **Authority boundary:** what they can and cannot do
- **Step 1–5 actions**
- **Dependencies**
- **Political cost**
- **Technical cost**
- **Failure modes**
- **Exit ramps**

**Effect:** people stop arguing abstractly and start seeing where friction actually lives.

## Component 2: Actor Playbooks

Stakeholders are not symmetric. The Execution Layer includes playbooks for each major actor class:

- governments
- regulators
- platforms
- infrastructure providers
- civil society
- standards bodies

Each playbook answers:

- what this actor optimizes for
- what pressure works on them
- what arguments fail with them
- what leverage they respect
- what risks they fear most

Playbooks link directly to briefs and claims.

**Effect:** users can reason strategically instead of morally posturing.

## Component 3: Second-Order Effects Engine

This is where most governance collapses. Every option includes a required **Second-Order Effects** section:

- **If this succeeds, what new problems does it create?**
- **Who adapts fastest?**
- **What incentives flip?**
- **What gets centralized?**
- **What becomes harder to undo?**

No option ships without this section.

**Effect:** prevents naïve solutionism and builds long-term credibility.

---

## Component 4: Reality Checks

Each brief includes a non-negotiable **Reality Check** block:

- enforcement capacity
- jurisdictional mismatch
- cost of compliance
- likely evasion behavior
- historical precedent (1–2 examples)

**Effect:** the platform earns respect from people who have actually tried to implement things.

---

## Component 5: The Fork Mechanism

Allow forks of briefs to keep pluralism without fragmentation.

Forks must:

- declare what they changed
- inherit claim lineage
- remain comparable side-by-side

No overwriting. No “correct” version.

**Effect:** pluralism without fragmentation, power without capture.

---

## Component 6: Outcome Tracking

Governance usually forgets itself. The Execution Layer attaches outcomes to briefs over time:

- policies adopted
- standards published
- court decisions
- major incidents

Each brief updates status: **unchanged / partially realized / failed / superseded**.

**Effect:** RealityLayer becomes a memory system, not just an argument engine.

---

## Component 7: The “This Will Hurt” Section

Every brief includes a required honesty section:

- who loses
- what they lose
- how badly
- whether mitigation is real or cosmetic

No euphemisms.

**Effect:** moral seriousness. People trust systems that admit pain.
