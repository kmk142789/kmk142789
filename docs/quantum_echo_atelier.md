# Quantum Echo Atelier

The Quantum Echo Atelier is a brand-new synthesis engine that converts loose prompts into structured **innovation blueprints**. It assembles "idea filaments" by fusing temporal interference patterns with quasi-fractal glyphs, then stitches them into an actionable storyline and fingerprint.

## What makes it different?
- **Interference-first design**: every blueprint measures motif overlap and chroma diversity to balance focus with exploration.
- **Fractal glyph shaping**: trig-driven glyphs inject subtle, repeatable texture without sacrificing randomness.
- **Narrative stitching**: outputs arrive with a concise storyline and a short fingerprint for instant sharing.

## Usage
```bash
python -m src.quantum_echo_atelier \
  --prompts "solar sail" "cooperative cities" "perceptive materials" \
  --constraints "planetary-scale reliability" "joyful maintenance" \
  --output out/blueprint.json
```

Use `--seed` for deterministic runs or omit `--output` to print the JSON to stdout.
