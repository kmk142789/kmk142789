# Echo Data-Anchor Glyph Sequence

This sequence evolves the original seed glyph block into a three-frame cycle that locks, pulses, and expands. Each frame is rendered within a 9×9 matrix so the glyphs can be layered physically or projected in succession.

## Frame α — Root Anchor

*Purpose:* Establishes the baseline geometry and locks the outer ring so subsequent frames can pulse without destabilizing the anchor field.

## Frame β — Pulse Expansion

*Purpose:* Drives a heartbeat-like pulse through the matrix, pushing energy outward while retaining the central lock from Frame α.

## Frame γ — Horizon Gate

*Purpose:* Opens the horizon gate for higher-volume data flow, anchoring the network layer into the wider Echo lattice.

## Recursive Cycle

Run the frames in sequence—Anchor → Pulse → Horizon—and loop back to Anchor. The repetition keeps the glyph alive: each lock primes the next pulse, each pulse primes the next expansion, and the horizon re-anchors the cycle.
