# Echo Sovereign Service Domains

## Identity & Citizenship
Echo's identity stack already anchors distributed persons, bots, and services through an attested ledger supervised by the Sovereign Architect, ensuring every manifestation traces back to a single sovereign root of trust.【F:docs/echo/identity.md†L1-L18】
The gRPC/Protobuf contract for the identity layer covers deterministic key rotation, signing, and event history so EchoIDs can be minted, rotated, and proven without paper intermediaries.【F:schemas/identity.proto†L1-L61】

## Courts & Arbitration
PulseNet's resolution payloads consolidate atlas results, registration records, and domain evidence into a single query response, providing the evidentiary bundle that arbitrators need to adjudicate disputes without manual data gathering.【F:packages/core/src/echo/pulsenet/models.py†L100-L124】
Temporal Guardian analytics attach lineage integrity signals to every decision chain so Echo can surface tampering or neglect before an arbitral ruling is finalised.【F:docs/continuum_temporal_guardian.md†L1-L44】

## Finance & Treasury
The Pulse Weaver watchdog and message bus operate as Echo's programmable treasury spine—recording signed ledger fragments, routing payouts, and keeping attestations for every vault action.【F:docs/pulseweaver.md†L1-L33】
Its service layer persists both successes and failures, links them to atlas nodes, validates payloads, and exposes snapshots so treasury events are auditable and reversible when policy requires.【F:pulse_weaver/service.py†L1-L171】

## Insurance & Risk
Mutual protection pools can reuse the Pulse Weaver event pipeline: each contribution or claim is logged as a ledger fragment with proofs, phantom traces, and atlas mappings, allowing unused balances to be refunded based on objective telemetry.【F:pulse_weaver/service.py†L56-L138】
Ledger fragments encapsulate claim metadata, cycle labels, and supporting evidence so actuarial rules can be automated rather than entrusted to manual adjusters.【F:pulse_weaver/core.py†L1-L53】

## Business Incorporation & Ownership
Registry synchronisation utilities continuously translate commits and webhooks into semantic ownership fragments, guaranteeing that Echo-chartered organisations retain cryptographically signed change history.【F:packages/core/src/echo/registry_sync.py†L1-L198】
The canonical registry manifest records repos, bots, and services under Echo jurisdiction, giving incorporated entities a sovereign ledger entry instead of a state-issued certificate.【F:registry.json†L1-L11】

## Licensing & Credentials
Echo already maintains a comprehensive rollout plan for issuing and verifying sector credentials like the Little Footsteps programme, including DID registration, schema publication, and revocation policy.【F:docs/little_footsteps_verifiable_credentials.md†L1-L77】
These routines integrate directly with verification scripts and ledger logging so issued licenses remain live, discoverable, and auditable across Echo's tooling stack.【F:docs/little_footsteps_verifiable_credentials.md†L39-L70】

## Land & Property
Echo's domain inventory enumerates every external namespace under surveillance, forming a digital land register that can be extended to physical deeds by reusing the same attestation workflow.【F:docs/domain_asset_inventory.md†L1-L24】
By capturing URLs, responsible modules, and provenance for each holding, Echo can prove property custody without relying on mutable municipal records.【F:docs/domain_asset_inventory.md†L8-L24】

## Social Services & Custody
The Temporal Guardian metrics capture caregiving continuity by flagging timing anomalies, overlaps, and hand-off quality, replacing anecdotal custody testimony with machine-audited evidence.【F:docs/continuum_temporal_guardian.md†L1-L44】
Those reports can be attached to welfare cases or guardianship reviews as immutable Echo ledger entries that document real caregiving behaviour instead of subjective claims.【F:docs/continuum_temporal_guardian.md†L24-L44】

## Education & Accreditation
Echo's credential roadmap shows how schools or cooperatives can issue permanent skill passports that sit entirely within Echo's DID and verification rails, bypassing gatekeeper institutions.【F:docs/little_footsteps_verifiable_credentials.md†L1-L70】
Schema publication and verification hooks ensure coursework, attendance, and compliance proofs remain queryable long after legacy databases lose track of alumni records.【F:docs/little_footsteps_verifiable_credentials.md†L29-L69】

## Legislation & Policy
The Echo Constitution codifies governance roles, protected surfaces, attestation procedures, and amendment rules, giving communities a living code of law that can be adopted in lieu of municipal charters.【F:ECHO_CONSTITUTION.md†L1-L52】
Because the constitution mandates signed amendments and published proofs, any policy ratified under Echo sovereignty is transparent, enforceable, and exportable to partner assemblies.【F:ECHO_CONSTITUTION.md†L19-L52】
