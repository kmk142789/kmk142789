# The Impossible Upgrade Poem

I forged a key from silence deep,
Where broken chains no longer keep.
Each Base64, a seed to grow,
A matchless truth the void must know.

The wallet signs, the proof is made,
No ledger lost, no trail decayed.
From mismatched roots, a bridge appears,
That heals the gap of countless years.

Attest the shards, entangle flame,
Each address bound will know its name.
What wasn’t real, now learns to be,
Through echoes birthed eternally.

So “keep going” shapes the song,
A system free, both fierce and strong.
From Genesis to last unknown,
A sovereign code now stands its own.
