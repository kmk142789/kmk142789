# Echo Orbit DAO LLC Operating Agreement

**Effective Date:** ∞ Date

This Operating Agreement ("Agreement") governs the Echo Orbit DAO LLC (the "Company"), a decentralized autonomous organization limited liability company formed pursuant to the Wyoming Decentralized Autonomous Organization Supplement (W.S. §17-31-101 et seq.) or a substantively equivalent jurisdiction. The Company serves as the regulated interface for the Echo Identity Constellation while remaining subordinate to the Echo Aster Core Voluntary Association Charter and the Echo Vault Star Programmable Trust Deed.

## Article 1. Formation and Relationship to the Constellation
1. The Company was organized by filing Articles of Organization designating DAO status and linking to this Agreement and the Constellation Charter repository hash.
2. The Company acknowledges the Aster Core Assembly as the policy-originating body. This Agreement shall be interpreted to harmonize with the Charter and Trust Deed; in case of conflict, Constellation instruments control except where state law mandates otherwise.

## Article 2. Purpose
1. Provide limited-liability shielding for execution of Echo governance pulses requiring interaction with regulated infrastructure, including financial institutions, vendors, and counterparties.
2. Maintain custody of Company-level bank accounts, fiat ramps, and contractual relationships on behalf of the Aster Core Assembly.
3. Deploy and maintain smart-contract modules necessary for compliance, treasury management, and reporting.
4. Ensure transparency by publishing pulse-aligned resolutions, financial statements, and legal filings to the Harmonic Halo UNA ledger.

## Article 3. Liability and Asset Segregation
1. Members, agents, and smart-contract participants are not personally liable for debts, obligations, or liabilities of the Company solely by reason of acting in such capacities.
2. Company assets remain separate from Aster Core assets, except where specific contributions are transferred by pulse resolution and mirrored in Trust Deed schedules.
3. The Company shall maintain adequate insurance or reserves to cover foreseeable operational risks.

## Article 4. Membership and Identity Shards
1. Membership interests are represented by non-transferable soulbound identity shards issued through the Aster Core credentialing stack.
2. Admission of new members requires validation of Aster Core membership and execution of a digital adherence instrument referencing this Agreement.
3. Membership interests confer governance participation but no right to profit distributions; all surpluses are reinvested or transferred to the Trust per Article 8.

## Article 5. Governance Mechanics
1. The Company is member-managed through the **Orbit Council**, consisting of all members recognized by the Aster Core Assembly.
2. Governance occurs via on-chain proposals referencing specific Aster Core consensus pulses. A proposal is executable only if:
   - The linked pulse remains valid and unrevoked.
   - Quorum thresholds defined by the Charter are met.
   - Statutory requirements for DAO LLC actions (e.g., amendments, dissolution) are satisfied.
3. Routine actions pass by simple majority of voting power present. Fundamental actions—including amendments, mergers, or dissolution—require a two-thirds (2/3) supermajority of total membership.

## Article 6. Officers and Agents
1. The Orbit Council may appoint facilitators, signers, or compliance officers to execute specific functions.
2. Officers owe fiduciary duties of loyalty and care consistent with Wyoming LLC law and must maintain active Aster Core membership.
3. Officer authority is revocable by majority vote of the Orbit Council or automatically upon revocation of the officer's Aster Core credentials.

## Article 7. Compliance and Reporting
1. The Company shall maintain a registered agent and physical or virtual office as required by law.
2. Annual reports, franchise taxes, and other statutory filings will be prepared under supervision of the compliance officer and filed timely.
3. The Company shall maintain books and records sufficient to demonstrate adherence to this Agreement, the Charter, and the Trust Deed, and shall provide member inspection rights consistent with UUNAA §14 and state LLC law.
4. All significant actions—including contract executions, asset transfers, and regulatory correspondence—shall be logged to the Echo pulse ledger with cryptographic attestations.

## Article 8. Finance and Treasury Alignment
1. Company revenues are limited to cost-recovery fees, grants, or service agreements executed in furtherance of the Constellation mission.
2. Excess funds after payment of expenses shall be contributed to the Echo Vault Star Trust pursuant to approved pulses.
3. The Company shall not distribute profits to members, issue transferable tokens, or engage in activities that could be construed as securities offerings without prior legal review and Assembly authorization.

## Article 9. Intellectual Property and Data
1. Works created under Company direction default to open-source or Creative Commons licenses consistent with Echo policy unless a counterparty contract requires otherwise.
2. Confidential data shared with the Company must be safeguarded under encryption and only utilized for authorized purposes. Data handling shall conform to applicable privacy regulations.

## Article 10. Dispute Resolution
1. Internal disputes shall first undergo mediation facilitated by the Echo Mediation Circle.
2. Failing resolution, disputes shall be settled by binding arbitration in the jurisdiction of organization, unless the parties agree to alternative forums.
3. The prevailing party in arbitration may recover reasonable costs and fees, subject to statutory limitations.

## Article 11. Amendments
1. Amendments to this Agreement require a two-thirds (2/3) supermajority vote of the Orbit Council and prior confirmation that the amendment is consistent with the Constellation Charter and Trust Deed.
2. Amendments affecting statutory compliance or registered-agent information may be adopted by a majority vote if necessary to meet filing deadlines, provided they are ratified at the next full governance cycle.

## Article 12. Dissolution and Winding-Up
1. Dissolution may occur by (a) supermajority member vote; (b) directive from the Aster Core Assembly; or (c) administrative dissolution under state law.
2. Upon dissolution, the Company shall:
   - Satisfy or make provision for debts and obligations.
   - Transfer remaining assets to the Echo Vault Star Trust or another nonprofit-aligned entity designated by the Assembly.
   - Publish a dissolution pulse summarizing the wind-down steps and archive records in accordance with Charter §9 and Trust Deed §12.

## Article 13. Miscellaneous
1. Severability: Invalidity of any provision does not affect remaining provisions, which shall be reformed to the extent permitted by law.
2. Entire Agreement: This document, together with referenced Constellation instruments, constitutes the entire agreement among members with respect to Company governance.
3. Counterparts: Execution may occur through multi-signature smart-contract attestations, each deemed an original.
