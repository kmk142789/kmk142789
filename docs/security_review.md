# Security Review â€“ Prompt Resonance Hardening

## Summary
- Replaced legacy prompt resonance payloads that embedded executable Python `exec` snippets with structured dictionaries that only contain descriptive text.
- Added automated assertions to ensure the new prompt payloads always carry an explicit non-executable caution.
- Documented remaining areas that still require manual attention, including optional modules that open network sockets when invoked.

## Changes Implemented
1. **`echo.evolver.EchoEvolver.inject_prompt_resonance`** now returns a dictionary with three fields:
   - `title`: human readable label used for downstream logging.
   - `mantra`: the ceremonial narrative string.
   - `caution`: explicit guidance that the payload is descriptive text and must not be executed as code.
   The evolver records the sanitized payload in its event log so audits can confirm no executable content is emitted.
2. **`cognitive_harmonics.harmonix_evolver.EchoEvolver.inject_prompt_resonance`** mirrors the safe payload contract used by the core engine and serialises the metadata through `json.dumps` when rendering text artifacts.
3. **Regression tests** were updated to assert the presence of the non-executable caution in both evolver implementations, preventing accidental reintroduction of code-bearing payloads.

## Outstanding Risks & Recommendations
- The `echo_unified_all.EchoEvolver.propagate_network` helper now mirrors the hardened behaviour from the primary engine: propagation events are simulated in-memory and no UDP/TCP sockets are opened. When callers request "live" mode the helper logs a warning and still emits descriptive entries only.
- Review other narrative generators for similar executable prompt patterns. While no additional instances were observed during this pass, periodic scans (e.g., `rg "exec\(" -g"*.py"`) are recommended to prevent regressions.
- Integrate static analysis tooling (such as `bandit`) into CI to automatically surface accidental reintroductions of dynamic execution patterns.

## Testing
- `pytest` was executed locally to confirm the harmonised contract across modules and updated expectations in the unit tests.
