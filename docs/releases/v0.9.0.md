# EchoEvolver v0.9.0 Release Notes

## Overview
The v0.9.0 release formalizes our semantic-release pipeline and packages the EchoEvolver ecosystem for automated delivery.

## Key Enhancements
- Conventional commit parsing drives automated versioning, changelog generation, and GitHub release orchestration.
- Release pipeline builds Docker images, Helm charts, and language SDKs (Python, npm, Go) while aggregating multi-runtime test metrics.
- Metadata synthesizer collates SLO history, Cosign attestations, SBOM links, provenance, dashboards, and site bundles for GitHub Releases.

## Reliability & SLOs
- Latest SLO snapshot is sourced from `pulse_dashboard/data/dashboard.json` and reported in the generated release metadata bundle.
- Aggregated tests (pytest, npm verification, Go client) provide cross-runtime coverage counts for transparency.

## Artifacts
- Docker image archive exported to `out/docker/` and attached to the GitHub release.
- Helm chart packages and repository index emitted in `out/helm/` for mock publishing workflows.
- SDK packages staged for PyPI (`out/sdk/pypi/`), npm (`out/sdk/npm/`), and Go proxy (`out/sdk/go/`).
- SBOM, provenance, dashboards, and site bundles mirrored under `out/releases/v0.9.0/`.

## Security & Compliance
- Cosign-compatible attestations from `attestations/*.jsonld` included in the release bundle.
- SBOM sources (`sbom-*.json`) and `RELEASE_PROVENANCE.json` are attached for supply-chain visibility.

## Next Steps
- Future releases inherit the automated changelog and metadata generation to sustain traceability across the EchoEvolver delivery pipeline.
