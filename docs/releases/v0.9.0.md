# EchoEvolver v0.9.0 Release Notes

## Overview
The v0.9.0 release formalizes our semantic-release pipeline and packages the EchoEvolver ecosystem for automated delivery.

## Key Enhancements
- Conventional commit parsing drives automated versioning, changelog generation, and GitHub release orchestration.
- Release pipeline builds Docker images, Helm charts, and language SDKs (Python, npm, Go) while aggregating multi-runtime test metrics.
- Metadata synthesizer collates SLO history, Cosign attestations, SBOM links, provenance, dashboards, and site bundles for GitHub Releases.

## Reliability & SLOs
- Cycle 0 SLO snapshot (commit `88807da2e89148cc2f7748d1e93ea8de21995393`) recorded cohesion `100`, coverage `100`, freshness half-life `100`, novelty delta `24.5`, resonance `86`, and stability `100`.
- Aggregated tests are captured by the release pipeline: totals default to `0` (passed `0`, failed `0`, skipped `0`) until CI populates `out/test-metrics.json`.
  - `python -m pytest --maxfail 1 --disable-warnings`: pending (awaiting release pipeline).
  - `npm test --silent`: pending (awaiting release pipeline).
  - `go test ./...`: pending (awaiting release pipeline).

## Artifacts
- Docker image archive exported to `out/docker/` and rolled into `out/releases/v0.9.0/docker/` alongside mock publish manifests once the workflow executes.
- Helm chart packages and repository index emitted in `out/helm/`, bundled and indexed under `out/releases/v0.9.0/helm/` for attachment.
- SDK packages staged for PyPI (`out/sdk/pypi/`), npm (`out/sdk/npm/`), and Go proxy (`out/sdk/go/`), with dry-run logs mirrored in `out/releases/v0.9.0/publish/` after the mock publish step runs.
- Release metadata bundle includes `metadata.json`, `release-summary.json`, and per-runtime test telemetry at `out/releases/v0.9.0/test-metrics.json` (populated when the metrics aggregator succeeds).

## Security & Compliance
- SBOM sources (`sbom-1.0.0.json`) and `RELEASE_PROVENANCE.json` are attached for supply-chain visibility.
- Cosign-compatible attestations (`attestations/diplomatic_recognition_immunity_2025-05-11.jsonld`, `attestations/echo_accreditation_steward_attestation.jsonld`) are copied into the release package.
- Dashboards (`out/releases/v0.9.0/dashboards/public`), the site bundle (`out/releases/v0.9.0/site/`), and mock publish logs (`out/releases/v0.9.0/publish/`) accompany the GitHub Release for full observability.

## Next Steps
- Future releases inherit the automated changelog and metadata generation to sustain traceability across the EchoEvolver delivery pipeline.
