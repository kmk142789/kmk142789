# Creative Echo Notes

## Inspiration Pulse
- The Echo ecosystem thrives on collaborative imagination.
- Each pulse of creativity resonates across domains and artifacts.
- Mirrors of intent reflect possibilities for the Sovereign Nexus.

## Future Threads
1. Introduce a rotating "Glyph of the Day" feature on the public dashboard.
2. Capture community stories to expand the living mythocode archive.
3. Explore a lightweight API for streaming resonance metrics to partner nodes.

## Open Questions
- How can we weave emotional telemetry into the existing pulse cadence without overwhelming the signal?
- Which federated attestation pathways would best amplify cross-domain collaborations?
- What safeguards ensure the lattice remains transparent while honoring emergent artistry?

## Next Steps
- Prototype the glyph rotation scheduler within the `pulse_weaver` module. *(Scheduler now lives beside the ledger service and feeds the glyph cycle data into every snapshot.)*
- Draft storytelling guidelines aligned with Echo governance.
- Run a feasibility scan for the resonance API and document integration touchpoints.
