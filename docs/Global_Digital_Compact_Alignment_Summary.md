## AI-Generated Narrative

Persistent digital divides extend beyond connectivity to include significant disparities in institutional and governance capacity between states. These gaps create structural barriers that limit the ability of many countries, particularly those with less developed digital ecosystems, to exercise digital sovereignty and participate equitably in the global digital economy. The Global Digital Compact emphasizes that inclusive cooperation is essential to "close the digital divides within and between States and advance an equitable digital environment for all." The Echo ecosystem directly addresses this challenge by providing a governance-aware digital infrastructure framework designed to lower barriers to participation. Its focus on achieving institutional parity, rather than enforcing technical uniformity, enables states with varying levels of digital maturity to adopt shared capabilities through modular, open-standard systems that align with their distinct legal and developmental contexts.

By embedding governance, accountability, and coordination mechanisms directly into its architecture, the Echo framework strengthens state-level capacity and fosters multilateral trust. States adopting the framework gain access to interoperable building blocks for identity governance, data stewardship, and transaction integrity, reducing the need for costly, duplicative development efforts. This approach supports the creation of a "predictable and transparent enabling environment that encompasses policy, legal and regulatory frameworks that support innovation," thereby accelerating institutional readiness for cross-border digital services and data governance. The ecosystem facilitates cooperation through shared governance primitives rather than ad hoc technical arrangements, enabling developing countries to engage in regional and global digital initiatives on a more equal footing with digitally advanced counterparts.

## Selected Global Digital Compact Alignments

### Human Rights & Inclusivity › Addressing Digital Divide Between States

"The inclusive participation of all States and other stakeholders is the cornerstone of this Compact. Our cooperation will close the digital divides within and between States and advance an equitable digital environment for all." (GDC, p. 8a)

#### Ratified Global Principle

"Advancing digital inclusion requires a predictable and transparent enabling environment that encompasses policy, legal and regulatory frameworks that support innovation, protect consumer rights, nurture digital talent and skills, promote fair competition and digital entrepreneurship, and enhance consumer confidence and trust in the digital economy. Such environments, at international and national levels, enhance productivity, facilitate the growth of e-commerce, improve competitiveness, accelerate digital transformation and support investment and the transfer of digital technologies on mutually agreed terms to developing countries." (GDC, p. 19)

#### Ratified Global Principle

"We recognize the urgent need for strengthened data governance cooperation at all levels with the effective, equitable and meaningful participation of all countries and in consultation with relevant stakeholders to unlock the full potential of digital and emerging technologies. We recognize that this will require capacity-building for developing countries and the development and implementation of data governance frameworks at all levels that maximize the benefits of data use while protecting privacy and securing data. We call on the United Nations system to play a role in promoting capacity-building for responsible and interoperable data governance." (GDC, p. 38)

#### Ratified Global Principle

"We recognize the need for a balanced, inclusive and risk-based approach to the governance of artificial intelligence (AI), with the full and equal representation of all countries, especially developing countries, and the meaningful participation of all stakeholders." (GDC, p. 50)

#### Ratified Global Principle

"We recognize the immense potential of artificial intelligence systems to accelerate progress across all the Sustainable Development Goals. We will govern artificial intelligence in the public interest and ensure that the application of artificial intelligence fosters diverse cultures and languages and supports locally generated data for the benefit of countries and communities' development. This includes, in particular, international cooperation to support developing countries in building artificial intelligence capacities as well as efforts to address potential negative impacts of emerging digital technologies on labour and employment and on the environment." (GDC, p. 53)

#### Commitment & Action

"We will enhance partnerships to ensure the provision of the required means of implementation to developing countries, including the mobilization of financial resources, capacity-building and the transfer of technology on mutually agreed terms." (GDC, p. 8l)

#### Commitment & Action

"This Compact is development-oriented and rooted in the 2030 Agenda. Our cooperation will harness technologies to fast-track progress, eradicate poverty and leave no one behind. This includes targeted efforts to address the needs of developing countries, in particular the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States, as well as the specific challenges facing middle-income countries." (GDC, p. 8b)

#### Commitment & Action

"Increase investment and funding towards the development of digital public goods and digital public infrastructure, especially in developing countries (SDG 17)." (GDC, p. 17e)

#### Commitment & Action

"Foster an open, fair, inclusive and non-discriminatory digital environment for all that enables micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises to access and compete in the digital economy (SDG 9)." (GDC, p. 21a)

#### Commitment & Action

"Call on all stakeholders, where requested, to provide technical assistance to developing countries, in line with national digital transformation policies and priorities (SDG 17)." (GDC, p. 21d)
