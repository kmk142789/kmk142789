# Echo Omni-Structural Uplift — Phase VI

## Purpose
Establish a unified meta-architecture that connects all Echo subsystems—recursive engines, ascension layers, DNS/identity authorities, attestation cycles, registries, governance roots, routing intelligence—into a single evolvable fabric.

## Meta-Architecture
- **Fabric Layer:** Shared message bus with signed envelopes, deterministic routing keys, and policy-aware channels for every module, bridge, and authority block.
- **Control Plane:** Orchestrates lifecycle events, module onboarding, schema migrations, and policy propagation via versioned governance roots.
- **Data Plane:** Streams state deltas, attestation proofs, and identity assertions through multiplexed channels; supports replayable event logs and adaptive QoS.
- **Capability Registry:** Normalized catalog of engines, modules, and policies with type-safe descriptors and dependency graphs.
- **Trust Substrate:** DNS/identity authority backed by rotating attestations, hardware trust anchors, and sealed audit trails.

## Autonomous Uplift Cycles
1. **Scan:** Inventory modules, bridges, policies, and authorities; validate schema and dependency integrity.
2. **Optimize:** Apply routing compaction, cache priming, and index tuning across registries and authority caches.
3. **Refine:** Normalize configs, converge on canonical schemas, and reconcile divergent governance roots.
4. **Harden:** Enforce key rotation, provenance validation, and tamper-evident ledger updates.
5. **Restructure:** Rebalance workloads across engines and ascension layers; retire deprecated flows.
6. **Elevate:** Generate new uplift directives from observed telemetry and reinject them into the fabric for recursive amplification.

## Governance & Policy Flow
- Versioned governance roots publish policy updates to the control plane.
- Policy bindings cascade to authority blocks, module registries, and routing intelligence nodes.
- Continuous attestation cycles confirm policy application and emit proofs to the trust substrate.

## Identity & Routing
- Unified identity propagation channel aligns DNS authorities, key material, and routing intents.
- Deterministic routing: `hash(identity || policy_version || attestation_root)` ensures stable paths across bridges and ascension layers.
- Fail-safe fallbacks: cached authority snapshots with expiry and quorum-based revalidation.

## Outputs per Uplift Pass
- Updated capability registry with dependency and health scores.
- Regenerated governance root manifest and attestation bundle.
- Routing intelligence diff with path optimizations and fallback maps.
- New uplift directives packaged for the next recursive cycle.

## Operational Notes
- Schedule uplift cycles on a cadence (e.g., hourly) with on-demand triggers from anomaly signals.
- Emit metrics for scan coverage, policy convergence, attestation freshness, and routing stability.
- Store artifacts (directives, manifests, proofs) in append-only logs for auditability.
