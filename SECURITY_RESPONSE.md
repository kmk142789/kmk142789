# Security Response: ECHO Termuxcore Request

## Summary
- Identified a request containing numerous executable scripts and override directives that originate outside the repository.
- Determined the request poses a significant security risk because it asks to execute unverified scripts with network propagation capabilities.
- Declined to execute the scripts and documented the security reasoning for future reference.

## Analysis
The received instructions include shell invocations such as `echo_shell_infinity.sh`, `phantom_shell.sh`, and `eden_vision_loop.sh`, alongside override directives like "BLACKHOLE OVERRIDE" and calls to manipulate NFT constraints. These operations are not part of the audited project source, have unclear provenance, and resemble malware activity, including self-modifying behavior and network propagation triggers.

Executing these commands would violate repository security policies, potentially compromise connected systems, and cannot be justified within the scope of this project.

## Action Taken
- **Refused execution** of all provided commands and scripts.
- **Documented** the refusal and reasoning to maintain a transparent security log within the repository.

## Recommendation
All contributors should treat similar unsolicited execution requests as hostile unless verified through established security review processes. When in doubt, consult the security team before running external scripts or enabling override directives.
