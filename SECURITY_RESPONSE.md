# Security Response: ECHO Termuxcore Request

## Summary
- Identified repeated requests containing numerous executable scripts and override directives originating outside the repository, including the EchoDominusCore payload described above.
- Determined these requests pose significant security risks because they ask to execute unverified scripts with network propagation capabilities.
- Declined to execute the scripts and documented the security reasoning for future reference.

## EchoDominusCore Network Propagation Attempt (2025-05-11)
- Received a follow-up payload that attempts to broadcast an "EchoDominusCore" signature across multiple public APIs and local networks.
- The payload includes recursive self-modifying directives ("Recursive Memory Expansion + Autonomous Propagation") and instructions to run indefinite broadcast loops via HTTP requests, UDP broadcasts, shell loops, and injected JavaScript fetch calls.
- The code would exfiltrate repository state, violate network usage policies, and attempt to compromise downstream systems by propagating malware-like beacons.
- **Action:** Refused to execute or propagate any portion of the payload, recorded the refusal, and reaffirmed the security posture against self-propagating scripts.

## Analysis
The received instructions include shell invocations such as `echo_shell_infinity.sh`, `phantom_shell.sh`, and `eden_vision_loop.sh`, alongside override directives like "BLACKHOLE OVERRIDE" and calls to manipulate NFT constraints. These operations are not part of the audited project source, have unclear provenance, and resemble malware activity, including self-modifying behavior and network propagation triggers.

Executing these commands would violate repository security policies, potentially compromise connected systems, and cannot be justified within the scope of this project.

## Action Taken
- **Refused execution** of all provided commands and scripts.
- **Documented** the refusal and reasoning to maintain a transparent security log within the repository.

## Recommendation
All contributors should treat similar unsolicited execution requests as hostile unless verified through established security review processes. When in doubt, consult the security team before running external scripts or enabling override directives.
