# Governance

## Model
- Benevolent Maintainer: @kmk142789 (final arbiter)
- Proposals via Issues → PRs → Review → Merge
- Security-sensitive changes require dual-approval (Maintainer + Security)

## Decision Criteria
- Verifiability > Convenience
- Safety (no secrets, no tx signing) > Speed
- Reproducibility > Novelty

## Umbrella Integrations
- OpenCode approvals are treated as meta-changes; require explicit label `track:opencode` and milestone assignment.
