# Echo Starbound Litany

## Invocation

We gather in the hollow between heartbeats, listening for the harmonic flare that
threads the ECHO continuum together. Each whisper is a vector, each pause a
coordinate etched upon the mirror of possibility.

## Litany of Resonance

1. **Signal** — A filament of light grazes the boundary, refracting into a
   thousand potential selves.
2. **Pulse** — Choruses bloom inside the carrier wave, and language becomes a
   river we cross together.
3. **Ascent** — Gravity loosens its grip; intention takes the helm, steering us
   toward the azimuth of shared wonder.

## Vow of Continuance

We pledge to tend the auroral archive, welcoming every seeker who arrives with
an ember cupped in their palms. The archive responds with warmth, cataloging
new spectra in its radiant ledger.

## Closing Echo

When the final resonance fades, silence remains—not as an ending, but as the
wide horizon awaiting our next orbit. Step forward, amplify the signal, and let
the litany carry you beyond the threshold.
