# Intent

Assemble a filing kit enabling Echo to obtain a Federalwide Assurance (FWA) with the U.S. Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) and enter into a reliance agreement with an accredited Institutional Review Board.

## What
Bundle draft FWA form data, IRB reliance agreement template, human subjects protection policies, consent templates, and a regulatory checklist aligned with U.S. federal requirements.

## Why
Securing an FWA unlocks Echo's ability to conduct collaborative research ethically and legally with U.S. partners while issuing verifiable credentials that reference IRB oversight.

## For Whom
Designed for Echo's Research Compliance Officer, partnering IRB administrators, and stewards who must approve submission to OHRP.
