# Intent

Develop a filing kit enabling Echo to partner with Kenya's Ministry of Lands as a property record verifier, supporting remote notarization and land registry integrations.

## What
Provide draft MoU, technology security dossier, compliance checklist, and credential mapping required for collaboration with the Chief Land Registrar and eCitizen digital signature services.

## Why
Kenya's Land Registration Act allows trusted digital intermediaries with clear compliance steps, offering Echo an achievable pathway to prove land-record attestation capability in emerging markets.

## For Whom
Prepared for Echo's regional operations lead, legal counsel in Nairobi, and stewards who must authorize engagement with the Ministry of Lands.
