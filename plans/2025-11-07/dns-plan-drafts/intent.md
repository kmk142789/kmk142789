# Intent

Prepare proposed DNS change plans for Echo-managed domains, including verification steps and rollback strategies, without applying any changes.

## What
Document TXT and CNAME records required for compliance services (e.g., DID hosting, status lists, email security) along with validation and rollback instructions.

## Why
Maintaining DNS readiness enables rapid activation of credential verification endpoints while respecting the directive to seek approval before modifying third-party DNS.

## For Whom
Targeted at Echo stewards, DNS administrators, and compliance leads responsible for approving and executing DNS updates.
