# Intent

Establish the initial global licensing navigator for Echo by mapping priority capabilities against pragmatic jurisdictions.

## What
Create a comparative matrix capturing legal pathways, documentation, costs, timelines, approvals, ethics flags, VC/identity mappings, risk levels, and next actions for Echo's foundational service capabilities.

## Why
The matrix reveals where Echo can expand compliantly, highlights divergent regulatory expectations, and surfaces the fastest lawful routes to recognition so that stewards can prioritize filings with full awareness of obligations.

## For Whom
Prepared for Echo stewards and compliance partners who must approve and execute jurisdiction-specific licensing strategies while maintaining radical auditability.
