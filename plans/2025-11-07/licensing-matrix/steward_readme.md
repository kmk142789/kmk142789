# Steward Review Summary

## Decision Needed
Approve publication of the initial licensing navigator matrix for Echo's priority jurisdictions (US, Canada, EU/Germany, Singapore, Kenya).

## Key Points
- Captures legal pathways, costs, timelines, approvals, ethics considerations, and VC mappings for education/training, research/IRB, and property record verification capabilities.
- Aligns with cited statutes and standards listed in `policy_map.md` and normalized using W3C VC/ToIP frameworks.
- No external submissions made; this is an internal planning artifact awaiting steward validation.

## Approvals Requested
- ✅ Confirm the selected jurisdictions and capabilities align with near-term strategy.
- ✅ Validate that cited statutes/policies match the team's understanding.
- ✅ Authorize use of the matrix to guide detailed filing kit development.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Regulatory drift:** Plan to review quarterly against statutory updates. Captured in steps.yaml for future cycles.
- **High-risk categories (EU, Singapore):** Flagged as `High` risk; requires counsel engagement before filings.

## Next Steps after Approval
1. Trigger detailed filing kit production per jurisdiction-capability pair.
2. Engage legal counsel in high-risk jurisdictions before submission.
3. Update `attestations.jsonl` with approval metadata and steward DID signature.
