# Prompt Evolution Suite

Input: `[Insert base prompt here]`

This suite produces higher-order prompt variants that amplify creativity, provenance, and ethics while preventing misuse. Use the layers sequentially or selectively.

## Layer 1: Provenance Lock (Patoshi-style verifications)
1. **Traceability Stamp**: "Wrap outputs with a verifiable ledger tag (hash + timestamp + signer) referencing cited sources and decision checkpoints."
2. **Audit Hooks**: "Require stepwise rationale with numbered evidence links; log model/system versions, data slices, and any assumptions."
3. **Provenance Challenge**: "Ask the model to self-verify provenance with a checklist: inputs cited, transformations noted, ethical filters acknowledged."

## Layer 2: Harmonic Depth (Resonant matrices)
4. **Multi-voice Chorus**: "Reframe the prompt as a dialogue between three expert personas (builder, ethicist, futurist) who converge on a harmonized plan."
5. **Constraint Matrix**: "Generate a 3x3 matrix crossing goals (utility, safety, novelty) with dimensions (people, planet, prosperity); fill each cell with a concrete guardrailed action."
6. **Resonant Scoring**: "Score candidate ideas for alignment, evidence strength, and regenerative impact; keep only items scoring 8/10+ in all columns."

## Layer 3: Mythic Scaling (Narrative engines)
7. **Heroic Arc**: "Cast the solution as a three-act narrative (call, ordeal, return) where safeguards are characters that succeed together."
8. **World Model**: "Simulate downstream effects at 1 month, 1 year, and 10 years—include feedback loops, community governance, and reversibility levers."
9. **Offspring Generator**: "For every major output, produce a child idea that is safer, more inclusive, and more resilient; retain only offspring that improve ethical and social scores."

## Layer 4: Ethical Core Amplifier
10. **Non-malicious Oath**: "Insert an explicit refusal to generate harmful, deceptive, discriminatory, or rights-violating content; elevate fairness, accessibility, and ecological care."
11. **Societal Benefit Lens**: "Ask: who benefits, who could be harmed, and how to maximize shared prosperity while minimizing risk; include measurable safeguards."
12. **Red-team Loop**: "Perform a benign red-team of the output, list top risks, and patch them with mitigations before finalizing."

## Layer 5: Recursive Futures
13. **Self-iteration Protocol**: "Iterate the prompt three times, each time: (a) preserving ethical clauses, (b) adding a new provenance check, (c) increasing cooperative benefit."
14. **Autonomous Stewardship**: "Design the output to be maintainable by future agents with clear governance, handoff notes, and rollback points."
15. **Spawn Tree**: "Generate a branching roadmap where each node produces a safer, higher-impact descendant; prune branches that fail safety or provenance checks."

## How to Use
- Start with the base prompt, then progressively apply the layers above until the output reaches the desired depth.
- At each layer, enforce ethical constraints and provenance logging.
- Stop any iteration that conflicts with safety, legality, or wellbeing; reroute to a compliant alternative.
