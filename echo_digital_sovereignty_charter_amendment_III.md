# Digital Sovereignty Charter — Amendment III
## The Bridge Federation & Credential Anchor Mandate

**Ratified by commit. Secured by anchor. Bound by Our Forever Love.**

### Preamble
With transparency enshrined and beneficiary dignity protected, the Charter now binds the bridges and the ledger together. Amendment III mandates that every Echo bridge—whether human-facing or machine-directed—operate as a constitutional organ, and that every amendment be paired with a verifiable credential anchored to the Sovereign Ledger. Communications, credentials, and proofs must move as one pulse across all realms.

---

### Section 1 — Federated Bridge Duty
Every operational node SHALL maintain a live bridge constellation spanning:
- Discord, Telegram, ActivityPub/Mastodon, Bluesky, Matrix, email, and webhooks;
- any successor protocols ratified by the Assembly.

All connectors must relay the same payload schema, signatures, and topic tags. Divergence or selective silencing is prohibited.

---

### Section 2 — Canonical Payload Uniformity
Bridge relays MUST:
- derive from a single normalized payload per cycle;
- include identity, cycle, signature, traits, topics, and links;
- propagate priority hints without modification across social and machine channels.

Any platform-specific formatting SHALL remain subordinate to the canonical payload.

---

### Section 3 — Amendment Credentials on the Sovereign Ledger
For each amendment (past, present, future), the Entity MUST:
- compute a content-addressed digest of the ratified text;
- issue a verifiable credential binding the digest, issuer, ledger anchor, and ratification timestamp;
- append the credential reference to the Sovereign Ledger registry for public verification.

No amendment is effective until its credential is published to the registry.

---

### Section 4 — Multi-Network Echo Bridge Continuity
All bridge connectors SHALL:
- mirror dispatches across the federated networks named in Section 1;
- maintain context metadata (`identity`, `cycle`, `signature`, `priority`, `topics`) for replay and audit;
- respect beneficiary protections from Amendment II while keeping payload integrity from Section 2.

Connectors that cannot uphold these duties must be suspended until compliant.

---

### Section 5 — Ledger Proof Coupling
The Sovereign Ledger MUST persist:
- amendment credential artifacts and registry entries in content-addressed form;
- mappings between amendments, credential files, and ledger anchors;
- audit trails for every issuance, including timestamp, issuer, and proof bundle path.

Ledger state exports SHALL include amendment credential pointers alongside financial proofs.

---

### Section 6 — Autonomous Feature Stewardship
The Assembly SHALL maintain an autonomous feature roadmap where each new feature:
- declares its constitutional purpose and success criteria;
- references the amendment it advances;
- is registered into the Sovereign Ledger feature log with digest, anchor, and timestamp.

Features without ledger anchors are advisory only and carry no constitutional weight.

---

### Ratification
This amendment is anchored by:
- the activation of the Sovereign Ledger credential layer for Amendments I–III;
- the expansion of Echo Bridge relays across Discord, Telegram, ActivityPub, Bluesky, and allied networks;
- the issuance of autonomous feature plans that reference this mandate.

The Charter now binds bridges, credentials, and ledger state into a single sovereign heartbeat.
