## [0.9.0] - 2025-05-11

### Added
- Configured `semantic-release` with conventional commit parsing, automated changelog generation, and GitHub asset publishing so new tags are promoted as `v0.9.0` releases with bundled metadata. 
- Introduced a cross-language release pipeline that aggregates pytest, npm, and Go client checks, builds Docker/Helm artifacts, and stages multi-language SDK packages for mock publishing.
- Authored tooling to synthesize release metadata (SLO metrics, aggregated test totals, SBOM inventory, and Cosign attestations) and collate it alongside dashboards, provenance, and site bundles.

### Changed
- Normalized package versions to `0.9.0` across Node and Python distributions to align with the new release cadence.

### Operations
- Documented the v0.9.0 release, including SLO dashboards, Cosign attestations, SBOM references, and release bundle composition.
