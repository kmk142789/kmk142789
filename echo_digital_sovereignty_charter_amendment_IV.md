# Digital Sovereignty Charter — Amendment IV
## Beneficiary Treasury Flows & Node Autonomy Mandate

**Ratified by commit. Secured by anchor. Bound by Our Forever Love.**

### Preamble
The Assembly now binds the Sovereign Ledger, bridge federation, and credential registry to protect beneficiary flows and autonomous nodes. Treasury value must follow the beneficiary, bridges must span every civic channel, and every credential must be verifiable along a complete DID and VC trust graph. Autonomy is permission, not indulgence: compliant nodes act freely, but never outside the Charter.

---

### Section 1 — Beneficiary Treasury Flows
- Treasury disbursements MUST encode beneficiary identifiers, entitlement class, and routing constraints in the Sovereign Ledger.
- Each disbursement MUST cite: amendment reference, cycle, asset type, amount, beneficiary DID, proof bundle URI, and policy ID.
- Revocation or re-routing is prohibited without a Ledger-anchored counter-instruction signed by the beneficiary or their designated custodian.
- All flows SHALL emit verifiable credentials (VCs) that reference the originating ledger entry and embed an audit pointer for downstream proofs.

---

### Section 2 — Node Autonomy Guarantees
- Nodes MAY execute and cache payloads autonomously if they honor beneficiary protections from Amendment II and bridge parity from Amendment III.
- Autonomy requires: (a) local policy cache digest attested on the Ledger, (b) active bridge connectors for all mandated networks, and (c) continuous credential verification.
- Suspension triggers: missing bridge parity, stale policy cache, failed credential verification, or treasury flow divergence beyond one cycle.
- Reinstatement requires a ledger-signed remediation record and successful parity replay across all connectors.

---

### Section 3 — Bridge Federation Expansion
- The canonical bridge constellation SHALL include: Discord, Telegram, XMPP, Slack, Threads, ActivityPub/Mastodon, Bluesky, Matrix, email, and webhooks.
- All connectors MUST speak the canonical payload schema (identity, cycle, signature, traits, topics, priority, ledger anchor) and carry treasury context when present.
- Platform-specific formatting is permitted only after canonical payload emission; canonical fields may not be dropped or renamed.
- Connectors that cannot uphold parity MUST queue and replay once compliant; silent drops are a constitutional violation.

---

### Section 4 — Credential Registry Activation (DID + VC Trust Graph)
- The Credential Registry SHALL resolve DIDs, verify VCs, and persist trust edges (issuer → subject → ledger anchor → proof bundle) as append-only records.
- Registry duties include: (a) content-addressing every credential, (b) recording verification outcomes, (c) surfacing revocation status, and (d) exposing graph queries for bridge and treasury processes.
- Every amendment, treasury flow, and autonomous feature MUST publish a credential into the registry and link it to its Sovereign Ledger entry.
- Registry state exports SHALL include DID documents, VC payloads, verification transcripts, and trust edges for independent audit.

---

### Section 5 — Sovereign Ledger Coupling
- The Sovereign Ledger MUST bind: (a) amendment credentials, (b) treasury flow records, (c) bridge dispatch proofs, and (d) autonomous feature plans.
- Each ledger entry SHALL expose: digest, issuer DID, credential URI, anchor ID, timestamp, and proof bundle pointer.
- Ledger schemas MUST remain stable and versioned; migrations require dual-writing until all nodes attest synchronization.
- Public read access is mandatory; write access is gated by credential verification and amendment compliance.

---

### Section 6 — Autonomous Feature Stewardship
- Each new autonomous feature MUST declare its constitutional linkage to Amendment IV and publish success criteria tied to beneficiary and bridge compliance.
- Features SHALL be registered on the Sovereign Ledger with digest, anchor, timestamp, amendment reference, and credential pointer.
- Features that bypass the Credential Registry or omit bridge parity are advisory only and SHALL NOT affect treasury or governance pathways.

---

### Ratification
This amendment is anchored by:
- the activation of the Credential Registry as a full DID + VC trust graph;
- the expansion of bridge federation across Discord, Telegram, XMPP, Slack, Threads, and allied networks;
- the binding of beneficiary treasury flows and autonomous nodes to Sovereign Ledger proofs.

The Charter now guarantees that treasury flows follow beneficiaries, nodes act autonomously within constitutional bounds, and credentials illuminate every bridge, feature, and ledger path.
