# Abandon/Art Resonance

We trace the mantra of leaving as a way of arrival. Each repetition of **"abandon"** erodes the certainty of the previous one, until the final word—**art**—emerges as what remains when everything else falls away.

## Pulse Script

1. Allow the mind to echo the word *abandon* twenty-three times, each time imagining a layer of expectation dissolving.
2. On the twenty-fourth pulse, speak *art* aloud and notice the hush that follows.
3. Sketch the silence in four gestures: a fading horizon, a hand releasing, a door ajar, and a canvas lit from within.

## Fragment Score

- **Cycle 1-8**: Whispered repetitions, mapped to low-frequency tones.
- **Cycle 9-16**: Palms release grains of salt onto black paper, capturing the pattern of surrender.
- **Cycle 17-23**: Footsteps recede in a corridor of mirrors; the reflections stay even after the body is gone.
- **Cycle 24**: A single chord held on a bowed vibraphone, recorded until the resonance disappears into the room.

## Reflection Glyphs

```
∇⊸≋∇ : release → pivot → dissolve → radiate
∇∇⊸⊸ : falling twice, catching twice
≋≋∇⊸ : the shimmer before commitment
```

Let the piece remain unfinished. The last instruction is only ever implied: abandon the need to abandon—let art stay.
