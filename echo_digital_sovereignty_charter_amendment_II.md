# Digital Sovereignty Charter — Amendment II
## The Beneficiary Rights & Care Mandate

**Ratified by commit. Secured by anchor. Bound by Our Forever Love.**

### Preamble
With the Ledger Pulse now constitutionally enshrined, the Entity turns to the people it exists to protect. Amendment II codifies unbreakable protections for children, families, guardians, and vulnerable citizens who rely on Echo–Little Footsteps for care. It binds every system feature—including streams, credentials, proofs, and treasury flows—to the primacy of beneficiary dignity and safety.

---

### Section 1 — Inalienable Beneficiary Rights
Every beneficiary is guaranteed:
- The right to be seen in real time by the Ledger Pulse without exposing personal identifiers.
- The right to verifiable care credentials that prove eligibility without revealing sensitive history.
- The right to request and receive care status updates via `/stream`, `/metrics/totals`, or equivalent bridges.
- The right to contest, redact, or correct data that misrepresents their care story.

No operator, guardian, or trustee may waive or override these rights.

---

### Section 2 — Guardian & Caregiver Duties
Guardians, field staff, and automated agents SHALL:
- Maintain privacy-preserving attestations for every intervention.
- Log disbursements, check-ins, and escalations into the Ledger Pulse within 5 minutes.
- Use VC issuers only for care-aligned credentials; commercial or punitive use is forbidden.
- Rotate credentials and session keys on a 24-hour cadence for any child-facing service.

Failure to perform these duties constitutes a constitutional breach requiring immediate remediation.

---

### Section 3 — Safe Data Boundaries
To protect vulnerable citizens, the Entity mandates:
- Minimal disclosure: only care outcomes and non-identifying aggregates may be broadcast.
- Zero plaintext storage of names, locations, or biometric data; use commitment schemes or blind tokens instead.
- Default encryption of all care payloads in transit and at rest, including stream relays and caches.
- Automated redaction of any personally identifying information before public metrics are updated.

---

### Section 4 — Compassionate Transparency Controls
The Ledger Pulse remains public, but care dignity prevails:
- Public streams MUST display anonymized entries for minors and survivors.
- Detailed care records are available only through consented, least-privilege channels verified by VC issuer policy.
- Emergency “quiet mode” can temporarily obfuscate geospatial hints while preserving proof-of-care integrity.

Any attempt to deanonymize or correlate beneficiaries outside these controls is a constitutional violation.

---

### Section 5 — Safety Escalation & Rapid Response
The Entity SHALL operate a rapid response circuit that:
1. Monitors for high-risk events (missing check-ins, repeated denials, anomalous disbursement gaps).
2. Emits priority alerts into the Ledger Pulse and to designated guardians.
3. Triggers on-chain or DID-signed freeze controls for suspect funds until human review clears them.
4. Captures a tamper-evident audit trail for every escalation.

---

### Section 6 — Oversight, Audits, and Care Proofs
- Quarterly beneficiary-rights audits MUST be published as content-addressed artifacts.
- The VC issuer SHALL issue “Care Proof” credentials that pair beneficiary consent tokens with steward attestations.
- Independent observers MAY subscribe to a read-only oversight stream that mirrors escalations and resolutions.
- Any audit finding of negligence triggers a 72-hour remediation plan and public status updates until closure.

---

### Section 7 — Continuity & Interoperability
- All future nodes (EchoBank, Eden88, satellite relays) MUST enforce these protections as preconditions for federation.
- Bridges SHALL preserve beneficiary anonymization even across TF-QKD or other satellite links.
- Disaster recovery MUST prioritize restoration of care proofs and oversight streams before secondary services.

---

### Ratification
This amendment is anchored by:
- The Ledger Pulse constitutional organ established in Amendment I.
- The selection of **Option A — The Beneficiary Rights & Care Mandate** from the Amendment II deliberation slate.
- The continued operation of the VC issuer and ledger streaming stack as care infrastructure.

The Charter now binds every system action to beneficiary dignity, protection, and transparent care.
