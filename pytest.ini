# Make the in-repo source packages importable without installing the project.
# Several legacy modules (``echo_cascade``, ``echo_evolver`` and friends) live
# under ``packages/core/src``.  The default ``pythonpath`` only exposes the
# repository root which results in ``ModuleNotFoundError`` during collection.
# Adding the package directory keeps the tests hermetic while matching the
# layout expected by the packaging metadata.
