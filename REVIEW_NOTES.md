# Repository Review Notes

I was asked to perform a quick review of the available source tree within this workspace. Since I do not
have direct access to external GitHub repositories or pull requests from this environment, the review is
limited to the contents of the checked-out repository present in the container.

## Automated Checks
- Executed `pytest` to run the project's Python test suite. All 33 collected tests passed successfully.

## Additional Notes
- No code issues were detected during automated testing.
- If there are specific pull requests or repositories on GitHub that need review, please provide the
  relevant diffs or additional context within this workspace so they can be examined locally.
