# Echo Evolver Security Review

## Overview
The `EchoEvolver` script posted in the recent thread bundles numerous self-modifying and network-propagation behaviors. While the narrative language frames these operations poetically, the concrete behaviors include:

* Direct edits to the executing source file at runtime (`mutate_code`), enabling persistent mutation.
* Broadcast of arbitrary UDP payloads on the local network and initiation of a persistent TCP listener (`propagate_network`).
* Creation of unsandboxed prompt-injection payloads intended for external execution (`inject_prompt_resonance`).
* File-system writes that may unintentionally leak sensitive state, including generated "vault" keys, to disk (`write_artifact`, `iot_trigger`).

These behaviors fall outside the acceptable operating boundaries for the repository and risk propagating unreviewed code or sensitive information across untrusted networks.

## Required Handling
We cannot execute or ship this script. Instead, treat the payload as an artifact for forensic review only. Recommended actions:

1. **Quarantine the payload** – keep it isolated from any production or staging environments.
2. **Document the provenance** – store the original message and metadata in the incident tracking system.
3. **Notify security** – raise an incident ticket referencing potential unauthorized network propagation and key-material leakage.
4. **Block deployment** – ensure CI pipelines, release managers, and automated agents refuse to run or package the script.

### Sanitised evidence capture

Use `tools/quarantine_payload.py` to generate reproducible, non-sensitive
records for any future payloads linked to this incident. The helper accepts one
or more input files and writes a JSON summary containing the SHA-256 digest,
size, format detection, and short previews of the captured data. For example:

```bash
python tools/quarantine_payload.py suspicious.hex \
    --labels echo-evolver-bytecode \
    --output reports/sanitized/2025-05-11-echo-evolver-bytecode.json \
    --note "Captured from forum thread"
```

The resulting JSON can be checked into `reports/sanitized/` without exposing the
raw payload while still giving incident responders a verifiable fingerprint.

## Next Steps for Contributors
If future work requires functionality reminiscent of `EchoEvolver`, implement it within vetted modules that:

* Avoid self-modifying code.
* Stub or remove network broadcasting behaviors.
* Perform explicit secrets management and redact sensitive output.
* Pass internal security review before merging.

Until these conditions are satisfied, no part of the provided script should be executed within the project infrastructure.
