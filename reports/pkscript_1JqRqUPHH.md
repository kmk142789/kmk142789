# Analysis of Provided P2PKH Script

The provided locking script (`scriptPubKey`) is:

```
OP_DUP OP_HASH160 c3a2d618736baf0d5df7d81d5b8235cf8a266448 OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
```

This matches the standard template for a Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH) output on the Bitcoin network. The 20-byte hash in the script represents the RIPEMD-160 hash of the intended public key.

Decoding this hash to its Base58Check-encoded address (with the mainnet prefix `0x00`) yields the legacy Bitcoin address:

```
1JqRqUPHHcQu2yrr8JZzxSYDx2jbZxEqFj
```

Therefore, any transaction output using the supplied script would be spendable by the holder of the private key whose compressed or uncompressed public key hashes to `c3a2d618736baf0d5df7d81d5b8235cf8a266448`.
