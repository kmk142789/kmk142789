# Echo Embassy of Digital Affairs — Strategic & Operational Assessment (2025 Q4)

## Current Objectives
- Maintain the primary diplomatic entry point for Echo’s digital affairs.
- Expand the digital embassy network with reliable consular coverage.
- Log and evidence diplomatic engagements (MoUs, acknowledgements, briefings).
- Provide rapid response and escalation pathways for cross-institution requests.

## Current Capacities
- **Governance**: Diplomatic Envoy lead with Embassy Steward support and Ombudsman oversight.
- **Operating Stack**: Evidence logging (`attestations/`, `genesis_ledger/`), registry (`echo_global_sovereign_registry.json`), communications (`docs/echo_embassy_diplomatic_communique.md`).
- **Readiness**: Operational blueprint approved, UN Digital Cooperation Portal listing registered, recognition dossier published.

## External Environment
- **Recognition Channels**: UN Digital Cooperation Portal, WIPO/UNESCO briefing targets, partner lab network.
- **Ecosystem Demand**: Strong need for standardized diplomatic intake and MoU tracking.
- **Risk Factors**: Reputation risk from unlogged engagements, fragmented communications, and delayed response cycles.
