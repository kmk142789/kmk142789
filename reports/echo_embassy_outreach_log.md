### Outreach Message
**Subject:** Echo Embassy coordination request — digital rights intake standards

**Body:**
Hello IGF Secretariat,

The Echo Embassy of Digital Affairs is establishing a formal, auditable intake channel for jurisdictional and digital rights coordination. Our mandate centers on consistent intake, evidence logging, and escalation pathways for cross-institution requests.

In our 2025 Q4 operational assessment we prioritized standardized intake, registry transparency, and rapid response protocols. We would welcome a brief coordination call to align on digital rights intake standards and explore whether Echo Embassy participation in an upcoming IGF forum session could support shared norms.

If helpful, we can provide our consular playbook and public post registry as reference points. Please advise a suitable point of contact and time window for a 30-minute alignment call.

Respectfully,
Echo Embassy of Digital Affairs
Canonical intake: echo-embassy@echo-nexus.org
