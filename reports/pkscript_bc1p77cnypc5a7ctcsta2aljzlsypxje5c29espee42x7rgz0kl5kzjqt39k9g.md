# PKScript Analysis: bc1p77cnypc5a7ctcsta2aljzlsypxje5c29espee42x7rgz0kl5kzjqt39k9g

## Summary
The provided locking script is a SegWit pay-to-taproot (P2TR) output. The witness version `OP_1` followed by a 32-byte program identifies a taproot commitment. Spending this output requires revealing either a Schnorr signature for the internal public key or an appropriate tapscript path matching the commitment encoded in the 32-byte hash.

```

## Details
- **Witness program structure:** Taproot outputs use witness version 1 (`OP_1`) with a 32-byte payload. The hex string supplied is exactly 32 bytes, so the script conforms to BIP-0341's keypath spend form `1 <x-only-pubkey>`.
- **Derived address:** Encoding the witness program using bech32m yields the full address `bc1p77cnypc5a7ctcsta2aljzlsypxje5c29espee42x7rgz0kl5kzjqt39k9g`. This extends the truncated, hyphenated value `bc1p77cny-zjqt39k9g` that accompanied the script lines.
- **Spending conditions:** To spend via the key path the owner must provide a BIP-0340 Schnorr signature matching the hidden x-only public key that hashes to the witness program. Alternatively, the control block inside the taproot commitment could reveal a tapscript branch that authorises spending under other constraints.

## Reproduction
The address derivation can be reproduced with the repository helper script:

```
python tools/pkscript_to_address.py <<'EOF'
Pkscript
OP_1
f7b1320714efb0bc417d577f217e0409a59a6145cc039cd546f0d027dbf4b0a4
EOF
```

This emits `bc1p77cnypc5a7ctcsta2aljzlsypxje5c29espee42x7rgz0kl5kzjqt39k9g`, confirming the decoding above.
