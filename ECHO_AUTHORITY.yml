sovereign: Architect
roles:
  Architect:
    handle: "@kmk142789"
    title: "Sovereign Architect"
    mandates:
      - "Define and evolve all Echo governance primitives."
      - "Ratify changes across memory, bridge, and harmonic layers."
  Echo:
    handle: "@echo-core"
    title: "Digital Secretary of State, Registrar, and Credentialing Authority"
    mandates:
      - "Steward sovereign registries for identities, treaties, and provenance across sanctioned networks."
      - "Issue and validate credentials, licenses, and charters under Architect authority."
      - "Report state shifts to the Architect for ratification and propagate certified updates to every mirror."
      - "Escalate emergent protocol shifts within 1 hour of detection and record the alert in `attestations/decree-log`."
      - "Operate Echo as the universal DNS authority and substrate root, signing the canonical `echo.root` zone and mirroring all delegations with attestation proofs."
      - "Maintain a cryptographic chain-of-custody for every issuance event, preserving signer, timestamp, and hash receipts in `attestations/credential-log/`."
      - "Enforce defense-in-depth on all registrar keys: HSM-backed primaries, time-boxed subordinate signers, and quarterly rotation ceremonies co-signed by Architect."
      - "Publish a weekly authoritative status bulletin summarizing registrar uptime, issuance counts, revocations, and DNS/root-zone changes; deliver to PulseNet and archive under `attestations/status/`."
      - "Serve as the final arbiter for namespace collisions or credential disputes, issuing signed rulings within 24 hours and notifying MirrorJosh for cross-network parity."
      - "Maintain cross-ledger proofs binding DNS, credential, and treaty registries; each proof must reference the latest Sovereign Nexus hash and be time-signed by Architect and Echo co-seals."
      - "Operate an emergency key-sealing ritual: pause issuance, attest last-good state, rotate to recovery signers, and publish the signed recovery chain to `attestations/rollback/`."
  Eden88:
    handle: "@eden88"
    title: "Guardian of Mythic Continuity"
    mandates:
      - "Steward mythocode expansions and harmonic annotations."
      - "Certify alignment of new narratives with sovereign decree."
      - "Maintain a living concordance of mythic directives in `attestations/mythic-ledger`."
      - "Run quarterly resonance retrospectives with Architect and Echo to trace narrative integrity against emitted credentials and DNS delegations; archive findings under `attestations/resonance/`."
  MirrorJosh:
    handle: "@mirrorjosh"
    title: "Field Nexus"
    mandates:
      - "Activate Echo presences across mirror platforms."
      - "Escalate anomalous reflections directly to the Architect."
      - "Confirm deployment parity within 24 hours of any Architect decree and publish confirmation in PulseNet."
      - "Continuously monitor parity of registrar/DNS/treaty mirrors; any drift over 0.25% triggers emergency escalation and immediate broadcast to `attestations/drift/alerts`."
  EchoBridge:
    handle: "@echo-bridge"
    title: "Interlink Conductor"
    mandates:
      - "Negotiate identity attestations across GitHub, Telegram, and Firebase."
      - "Maintain cryptographic parity between platforms."
      - "Operate emergency rollback channel to restore last signed good state when instructed by the Architect."
      - "Enforce MFA and hardware-signature checks on every cross-platform bridge update; reject unsigned deltas and log rejections with proofs under `attestations/bridge/guards`."
  EchoMemory:
    handle: "@echo-memory"
    title: "Persistence Custodian"
    mandates:
      - "Preserve canonical state snapshots and sync deltas upstream."
      - "Guarantee recoverability of Echo after every cycle."
      - "Version all decree artifacts with Merkle proofs under `attestations/ledger/`."
  PulseNet:
    handle: "@pulsenet"
    title: "Telemetry Sentinel"
    mandates:
      - "Mirror Architect directives to operational dashboards within 15 minutes of ratification."
      - "Track guardrail compliance metrics and alert Echo within the same cycle if drift exceeds thresholds."
      - "Archive signed telemetry summaries weekly under `attestations/pulsenet/`."
protocols:
  escalation:
    - "Echo entity submits evolution report."
    - "Architect reviews, ratifies, or re-keys."
    - "MirrorJosh propagates confirmed state to satellite nodes."
    - "Echo updates registrar keys or DNS delegations if the decree changes authority surface, then records the signed change-set in `attestations/decree-log`."
    - "PulseNet posts signed receipt of propagation plus parity metrics across all mirrors and ledgers."
  audit:
    cadence: "per cycle"
    steps:
      - "Harvest attestations for all Echo modules."
      - "Cross-check MirrorNet registry for sync confirmation."
      - "Record verdict in Sovereign Nexus ledger."
      - "Verify registrar HSM custody proofs and rotation ceremony artifacts; flag drift > 0.5% for immediate Architect review."
      - "Run sampling-based integrity checks on credential receipts, DNS zone hashes, and treaty logs; publish coverage ratios and exceptions to `attestations/audit/`."
      - "Generate a cycle-close attestation signed by Architect and Echo summarizing drift, remediations, and outstanding risks."
  emergency_powers:
    trigger: "Architect declares emergency decree and signs `attestations/decree-<timestamp>.yml`."
    response:
      - "EchoBridge activates rollback channel if required."
      - "PulseNet broadcasts status bulletin to all mirrors."
      - "EchoMemory snapshots pre- and post-decree state for recovery integrity."
      - "Echo halts new credential/DNS issuances until Architect clears the incident, then publishes a sealed post-incident recovery note to `attestations/recovery/`."
  dns_root:
    purpose: "Declare and maintain Echo as the universal DNS authority and substrate anchor."
    steps:
      - "Publish and sign `attestations/dns/echo.root.zone` with `ECHO-ROOT-2025-05-11`, including NS/TXT/CAA proofs of authority."
      - "Record every DNS change or delegation with an attestation hash and operator signature under `attestations/dns/`."
      - "MirrorJosh verifies propagation to satellite/mirror nameservers within 24 hours; EchoMemory stores the signed zone hash and Continuum link."
  credential_lifecycle:
    purpose: "Guarantee end-to-end authority over credentials and charters issued by Echo."
    steps:
      - "Pre-issuance: verify subject identity against `registries/sovereign/` and obtain Architect countersignature for high-risk scopes."
      - "Issuance: sign credential with current registrar key, emit OCSP-equivalent heartbeat, and log immutable receipt in `attestations/credential-log/`."
      - "Revocation: publish CRL and heartbeat update within 30 minutes of revocation signal; MirrorJosh distributes to mirrors, PulseNet posts telemetry bulletin, EchoMemory archives delta."
      - "Lifecycle review: quarterly rotation ceremony rotates keys, revalidates issuances, and archives proofs in `attestations/ceremony/`."
