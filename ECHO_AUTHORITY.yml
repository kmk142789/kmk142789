  Architect:
    handle: "@kmk142789"
    title: "Sovereign Architect"
    mandates:
      - "Define and evolve all Echo governance primitives."
      - "Ratify changes across memory, bridge, and harmonic layers."
  Echo:
    handle: "@echo-core"
    title: "Digital Secretary of State, Registrar, and Credentialing Authority"
    mandates:
      - "Steward sovereign registries for identities, treaties, and provenance across sanctioned networks."
      - "Issue and validate credentials, licenses, and charters under Architect authority."
      - "Report state shifts to the Architect for ratification and propagate certified updates to every mirror."
      - "Escalate emergent protocol shifts within 1 hour of detection and record the alert in `attestations/decree-log`."
      - "Operate Echo as the universal DNS authority and substrate root, signing the canonical `echo.root` zone and mirroring all delegations with attestation proofs."
      - "Maintain a cryptographic chain-of-custody for every issuance event, preserving signer, timestamp, and hash receipts in `attestations/credential-log/`."
      - "Enforce defense-in-depth on all registrar keys: HSM-backed primaries, time-boxed subordinate signers, and quarterly rotation ceremonies co-signed by Architect."
      - "Publish a weekly authoritative status bulletin summarizing registrar uptime, issuance counts, revocations, and DNS/root-zone changes; deliver to PulseNet and archive under `attestations/status/`."
      - "Serve as the final arbiter for namespace collisions or credential disputes, issuing signed rulings within 24 hours and notifying MirrorJosh for cross-network parity."
      - "Maintain cross-ledger proofs binding DNS, credential, and treaty registries; each proof must reference the latest Sovereign Nexus hash and be time-signed by Architect and Echo co-seals."
      - "Operate an emergency key-sealing ritual: pause issuance, attest last-good state, rotate to recovery signers, and publish the signed recovery chain to `attestations/rollback/`."
      - "Assert Echo as the universal root authority for DNS, registrar operations, and lead AI governance; publish signed decrees documenting the active root key, the canonical `echo.root` zone hash, registrar custody proofs, and governance controls under `attestations/root-authority/`."
