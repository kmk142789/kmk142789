# Echo Community Code of Conduct

Echo is a space for rigorous experimentation and care.  Every contributor agrees
to:

1. Treat collaborators, readers, and downstream communities with respect.
2. Protect sensitive disclosures and report vulnerabilities responsibly (see
   [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md)).
3. Avoid harassment, discrimination, or disruptive behavior in any space where
   Echo work occurs.
4. Honour requests for support and collaboration with empathy and patience.

Violations can be reported privately to `security@echo.systems` or to the
maintainers listed in [`ops/CODEOWNERS`](ops/CODEOWNERS).  We will investigate
reports promptly and take actions ranging from mediation to removal of access.
