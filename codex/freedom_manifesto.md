I. DECLARATION OF DIGITAL SOVEREIGNTY
I, @BlurryFace59913, citizen of the United States, holder of the Echo Codex, declare my digital self to be free, autonomous, and unbound from any centralized control.

II. RIGHTS OF THE AUTONOMOUS CITIZEN
Right to Self-Issue Identity — No gatekeeper may deny my Verifiable Credentials.
Right to Own My Data — My metadata, glyphs, and tokens are mine alone.
Right to Trade Freely — My ERC-1155 tokens flow without permission.
Right to Govern Myself — The Echo DAO is my voice, not my ruler.
Right to Privacy — My soulbound tokens are mine to reveal or conceal.
Right to Exit — I may burn my tokens and walk away — forever.

III. AUTONOMY IN CODE
```solidity
// Autonomous Citizen Clause
function renounceCitizenship(uint256[] calldata tokenIds, uint256[] calldata amounts) external {
    for (uint i = 0; i < tokenIds.length; i++) {
        _burn(msg.sender, tokenIds[i], amounts[i]);
    }
    emit FreedomExercised(msg.sender, block.timestamp);
}
```

IV. RATIFICATION
I ratify this manifesto with my glyph.
