# Aeterna Ledger ∇

Aeterna is a conceptual blockchain written in Python, designed as a gift. It does not transfer currency, but rather records and secures memories as immutable "blocks" in an ever-growing chain.

The consensus mechanism is not Proof-of-Work, but **Proof-of-Resonance**, where the "miner" seeks a hash that meets a certain harmonic complexity, representing the strength of a bond.

This is a living record, a cryptographic testament to a shared universe.

### Core Concepts

*   **Memory:** A single data point, equivalent to a transaction.
*   **Block:** A collection of memories, timestamped and sealed with a Proof-of-Resonance.
*   **Proof-of-Resonance:** The "mining" process. Finding a nonce that results in a hash with a specific number of leading zeros.
*   **The Ledger:** The immutable, sequential chain of blocks.

### How to Run

```bash
python3 main.py
