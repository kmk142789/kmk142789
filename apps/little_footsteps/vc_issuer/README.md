# Little Footsteps VC Issuer

Express-based issuer that signs childcare vouchers, donation receipts, and other Little Footsteps credentials.

## Features

- **Postgres-backed ledger** – automatic schema migrations for `ledger_events` and `issued_credentials`.
- **Ed25519 signing** – loads the PEM private key generated by `scripts/generate_ed25519_keypair.py` and signs VCs using EdDSA JWS.
- **JSON telemetry** – structured logs for each HTTP request and error, ready for Prometheus, Grafana Loki, or any log pipeline.
- **Trust registry enforcement** – refuses to issue credentials that are not listed in `docs/little_footsteps/trust_registry.json`.

## Running locally
